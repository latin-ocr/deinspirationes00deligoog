position oi Sacred Scripture. It was always and specifically ad
scribendum and in scribenda. It was to be conceived of as either
a verbal dictation or a suggestion of words, which renders the
writers as the passive organs, the pens, the amanuenses of the
Holy Spirit. It covered and guaranteed all the contentS, of
every kind and in every detail, of the biblical books. This
view really destroys the vitality and vital organic relation of
revelation and inspiration. It withdraws from consideration
the nature of the human personality; for it considers this per·
sonality orily as the most convenient kind of instrumentality‚ a
writing-machine of God.

On the other hand, the nature of inspiration, and its relation
to revelation, may be totally misconceived when seen from an
opposite point of view. The agent, the subject, and the final
purpose of revelation are the considerations which enable us to
fix, so far as is possible, the nature of inspiration. Without
inspiration, revelation cannot complete itself, cannot become a
divine sels-communication actually realized. For inspiration is
the subjective condition of revelation. The truth is very nearly
expressed by this declaration of Dorner: “ Revelation, becom-
ing imparted to the spirit (of man) is, so far as its form is con·
cerned, inspiration.” But, inasmuch as we use the word reve·
lation in two principal meanings‚ as objective and as subjective,
it becomes difficult to distinguish inspiration from the latter use
of the word revelation. To the mind of the recipient, that
alone is a revelation which has already become known; and the
divine activity in making that which is divine known to man is
an act of divine sels-revelation. But since this divine act takes
place within the mind of man, and is conditioned upon the laws
of the mind, the form in which it takes place is a spiritual activ-
ity produced by God: the act, that is to say, is, as to its form,
inspiration. Can we, then, distinguish between revelation, in
its subjective meaning and aspect, and inspiration which is,-

according to the statement made above, the subjective condi· '

tion of revelation? We may thus distinguish only if we remem-
ber that the distinction is largely one of emphasis and formal
expression. We may distinguish in the following three particu-
lars: a. The word revelation, even in its subjective use', lays
emphasis 'upon knowledge rather than upon the feelings and
