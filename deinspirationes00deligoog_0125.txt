Every one knows that where this Book has influence it makes
things saie. Why is this! Is it were a bad book, we should
expect to find it in the hands of the worst men. In New York
there was once a kind of rogue’s museum—a place where they
had all kinds of skeleton·keys, and jimmies, and brass knuckles,
and dirks‚ aud pistols, and implements of mischief, which they
had taken away from roughs and criminals. Do you suppose
there was a single New Testament in the whole kit? Why not!
If it were a bad book you would expect a man to have a revolvor
in one pocket, and a New Testament tucked away in another.
There was a row‚ the other night, and a man broke his wife’s
head with a—Bible 2 No 1 it was a botta! Where the Bible
bears sway, the rows and quarrels do not come.

What makes this Book so different from all other books?
whose book is it ἲ Who made it ἲ Infidels have the strangest
ideas of that subject. 1 recollect in Marlboro‚ Mass„ Ι read in
a paper an article written by an infidel, which stated that the
Oouncil of Nico in the year 825, compiled the New Testament.
They had a lot of Gospels and Epistles, genuine and spurious,
and no one could distinguish between the two3 so they put them
all on the floor, and prayed that the good ones might get up on
the communion table and the bad ones stay on the floor3 and
that was the way that the present New Testament was compiled.
And that is the kind of food that the infidels are made to swal-
low and digestg'for that very statement can be found in infidel
books now published in Boston. This writer said that this
account rested on the authority of Papias, an early Christian
bishop. I replied in a lecture, that there was one difficulty
about that story—that Papias was dead and buried a hundred
and fifty years before the Oonncil of Nice was held3 but as they
might have got the news from the spirits, that might be no great
objection. 'rhe man rose to explain, and said that this was not
the right Papias, but that it was another Papias, an obscure
Christian bishop of the fourth century. 1 told him 1 thought
he was obscure, so obscure that no one ever heard of him before
or since. On investigation it was learned that a German dom·
inis, named John Pappus, preacher in Strasburg‚ and a profes-
sor at Munster‚ who died in 1610, discovered this story in an
