lievers——indeed practically deified humanity. Mysticism had, it
is true, been purified in proportion to the development of its bibli·
cal factor, but its (in measure at least untoward) influence upon
the reformem, especially upon Luther, Zwingle and others is not
only traceable outwardly, but is clearly proved by internal evi-
dence. Example is seen in the tendency of these men to J udge
‘of Holy Scripture according to a standard purely subjective—

what it had done for them in personal experience, rather than by - ⁴

Christian teachers in any age, not even the advocates of th'e most
rigid theory of mechanica] inspiration, ever so exalted the dig-

has often otherwise seemed anomalous and unaccountable.

G. THE DOCTRINE OF¹ INSPIR'ATION DURING
THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.

1. Lutheran.

It was, partially at least, a polemic interest and tendency that
led to the abandonment of the generally free view of inspiration
held by the early reformers, and the development of those ex-
treme ideas, especially in the Lutheran theology of the seven-
teenth century, which wholly suppressed the human element in
the composition of the sacred records, and attributed to their cou-
tents a mechanical, literal divinity. Luther’s free view had been
abused by the church of Rome to the furtherance of her doctrine
of the insufficiency and obscurity of the Scriptures, and of the
authority and supremacy of ecclesiastical tradition. Protestant
