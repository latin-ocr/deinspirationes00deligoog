ure, but by the continued and gentle pressure of the indwelling
Holy Spirit, all the contemplative powers of the author have
been raised to 'their divine exaltation and purity. How differ-
ent, however, the case of the Apocalypsc·‚ with its constant suc-
cession of visions seen in ecstasy, and its relative depression and
disuse of all the quieter contemplative powers,

“ 8. Inspiration involves an effect upon the powers of utter-
ance‚ but is not verbal, in the technical sense of the term. The
former theory of verbal inspiration cannot stand for a moment
against an inductive doctrine of the nature of Sacred Scriptures.
Nor can we approve the substitute which Philippi has ventured
in the shape of a Word·inspiration which is still not an inspira-
tion of the words. Nor is the more careful statement of Beck
sufficiently accurate: “ The welding of word with thing, of state-
ment with content, in the one production of the Spirit of reve·
lation‚ lies in the very nature of the case.” And yet the funda-
mental psychological truth which underlies the theory of Phi-
lippi is undoubted in its application to the case. Thought, the
content of truth, and inner language as the form of thought,
cannot be separated. We cannot conceive of inspiration as not
involving the faculties of language. Precisely to what degree,
and in what form the supernatural and spiritual inworking may
be detected in the language of the inspired, is a matter for de-
vout and fruitful linguistic research.

9. Inspiration is not infallibility. Indeed the older form of
the theory of infallibility follows from the same assumptionS,
made on false grounds of the necessities of saith, which vitiated
its conceptions of the nature of inspiration and revelation.

10. In inspiration, the point and kind of union between natu-
ral and supernatural, and the modus operandi, are concealed and
mysterious; but inspiration is not therefore incredible or irra-
tional. That the precise point and kind of union, which takes
place between the divine energy and the activities of the human
spirit, should remain concealed, is accordant with all the analo-
gies of experience. Precisely how and where physical forces
unite, or are correlated and conserved, we do not know. ι What
appears is ever phenomena; and the real forces lie concealed.
The modus operandi of the causal relation between body and
