54 ‘rim nocrmnss or mermATmn:

make appeal to his investigations T’ ¹ Grotius conceded the can·
onicity of Luke's writings, but only on the ground that in the
opinion of the primitive church they ‘ are true, pions, and treat
of important subjecte.’²

3. Episcopius († 1643) goes still further, and says that the sa·
cred writers might readily err, since in historical and related
kinds of composition, for which the unaided human faculties
were sufficient, they were left wholly to themselves, To the ob-
jection that on this basis they might err even in essential things,
he replies·that God did not entrust matters of great moment to
human weakness, but reserved them to his own guidance and
control.⁸

He argues also against the strict view of inspiration, that many
books of Scripture either contain nothing which others had not
given in greater detail, or at least are not especially edifying.
Mention is also made of the fact that the so-called canonica] writ-
ings were not collected in obedience to eapress divine command.⁴

4. Le Clerc († 1737), one of the most learned theologians of his
age, held that genuine divine revelation renders inspiration need·
less, The prophecies themselves were communicated by revela-
tion to the prophetS, who carefully remembered them, but re—
corded them, each in his own style, so that it could not be said
that· they repeated the very words which they had heard.⁵

The historical books require no inspiration, and prove their ac·
tual want of the same by internal contradictions.⁶ Equally un-
necessary is the supposition of inspiration in the case of the doe-
trina] books of the Old Testament3 and as for the N ew Testa-²
ment, the ‘assistamoe’ of the Holy Ghost was amply sufficient for
all purposes. ⁰

Christ had promised that the ⁶ Spirit of the Father’ should
speak through the disciples (Matt. 10: 20), but this he interpreted
to refer to the spirit of holiness and steadfastness with which they
would endure persecutions, and defend their doctrine.
