language of revelation is to a large extent the expression of a
kindled imagination: the tendency of inspired souls is to speak
in glowing and figurative terms. By its rapid and wonderful
working, the inspired imagination combines the elements of new
intuitions and old memories into higher formS, which in their
turn present themselves before the mind as intuitions to be
ascribed to the gift of God. That memory is employed, with
due observance. of its fundamental laWS‚ by the Spirit of revela-
tion and inspiration, belongs to the historical nature of revelation
itself. Only what is remembered of the original intuitions of
revelation can become of value to the future. The unremem-
bered portion is for the purposes of history a lost portion. In
the sels-conscious effort to form a record of revelation, memory
is,- of course, a faculty whose due activity is indispensable. But
furthermore, the organic and gradual nature of revelation cannot
be preserved without the activity of memory. There seems», then,
a special reason why the promise which our Lord made to his
disciples should dwell upon the significant fact, that the office of
the Spirit should be to bring to their remembrance the truth of
Christ. We cannot say, on a priori grounds, that the merely
natural memory would be insufficient for the final purpose of
revelation ; but we can say that theconstitution of man is such
as to involve an inspiration ·of memory, if there is to be any
inspiration that shall penetrate and control its varied powers,
Furthermore, nothing but that abstract and misleading view of
the nature of man’s faculty of reasoning which has so largely
prevailed from the days of Aristotle to the present time, could
lead to the claim of Morell and others—this faculty cannot be-
come the instrument of revelation, because the logical processes
never expand the horizon of our mental vision. That which is
revealed is truth3 but it is not truth as made over to man in
definite propositions fit for syllogistic defence and handling.
Inspiration neither makes nor changes the logical laws of non-
contradiction and excluded middle. One does not need special

 

revelation to affirm that A is not non-A3 nor does it take a seer Χ

to discover that the conclusion follows from the premises when
the middle term is properly distributed. But, in this real life of
inference and opinion regarding moral and religious verity, men
do not deal with counters, and letterS, and abstract termS, such
