about that man you might not feel so deeply on the subject.

Do· you suppose that if the Bible had been revised by a com-
mittes of eminent divines, and published by some great relig⁴
ious society, we should ever have heard of Noah’s drunkenness,
of Jacob’s cheating, of Paul and Barnabas quarreling, or of Peter
lying, cursing, or dissemblingl Not at all. The good men, when
