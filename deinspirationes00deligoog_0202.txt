50 THE Doc'rnmn 01²· INSPIRATION:

4. More Liberat Viewe.

A few Lutheran theologians had the courage to array them-

selves against the doctrinal exaggeratione of their contemporarieS‚

though the result was to draw upon themselves the charge of un-
soundness in the saith, and even the accusation of positive heresy. . ¹

Ohief among them were Musaeus a'nd Calixtus.

a. Musaeus (·† 1681) ventured to express doubts whether inspi-
ration extended to the words as well as to the matter of the Scrip-
tureS. He even· designated verbal inspiration as an undecided and

improbable opinion. But for this hardihood he was violently op-

posed by the zealous orthodox divineS‚ especially by Calovins‚
and was compelled to retract his utterances.

b. Oalixtus († 1656) wished to distinguish between revelation
or inspiration in the κινέει seme, and mere dimine assistoenee.
To the former he would ascribe only the chief doctrines of the
Scriptures‚ viz., those relating to huma-n redemption and final sal-
vation. For other things which might be learned from the

light of nature or through experienoe, he claimed only that divine ·

assistance which guarded the sacred writers from error, and en-
abled them to record that which was ⁶ consonant with fact, true,
worthy and suitable.’ For these too free views Oalixtus found
himself‘charged with heresy.¹

5. T he Lutheran Symbola.

The silence of the Lutheran symbolic book's respecting inspira-
tion has often been remarked. The explanation seems to be that
the fact is presupposed‚ while, for various reasons, implied in what
has been said above, no specific them-y is proposed. Incidental
expressions are found in the Apology‚ in the Smalcald ArticleS‚
and in the Formula of Cuncord, which confirm this view.

' 11. Reformed.

The Reformed churches of the continent were generally in
harmony with the Lutheran in their doctrine of sacred Scripture.
Within the former a somewhat animated controversy was carried
on respecting the inspiration of the vowel-points of the Hebrew
text. The principa] ’ disputants were the two Buxtorffs, father
