230 THE JoURNAL OF CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPH Y.

πατήρ, the living· Fatlter, at another he declares to be distinc-
tively Spirit, πνεῦμα. This declaration has a theological sig-
nificance which covers all the distinctive 'features of the New
Testament dispensation. As the author of spiritual and eternal
life in the believing community, and, through its officeS, in the
world at large, God is, and becomes known as being, a Spirit
preeminently. The Evangelists represent Jesus as begotten by
the Spirit, endued with the Spirit, led and sustained in his min-
istry by the Spirit. From the later advanced point of vieW, as
occupied especially by Paul, Christ himself appears as the life-
giving ethical power, and is declared to be the Spirit: the in-
dwelling of Christ and of the Spirit is one and the same potency
of a new life. *The sending ‚of the Spirit by the Risen One and
his coming is equivalent to the personal reappearance and
presence of Christ himself. The new birth of the Christian be-

the soul is then born. The donative work of the Spirit dis-

preeminently the kingdom of‘ the Holy Ghost. In one word,
the work of the Divine Spirit is presupposed and implied in
every movement for the founding and developing of the King-
dom of Redemption upon earth. Inspiration, in the only true
and comprehensive, yet specifiC, sense of the term, is the result
in man’s spirit of that activity of the Divine Spirit which accom-
panies all the historical process of the sels-revelation of God as
the Redeemer of mankind.

But God is only one of the two personal beings concerned in
those spiritual transactions which we call revelation and inspira-
tion. These, transactions are between persons: they involve the
conception of another and finite personality regarded as set
over against God. To such transactions the second party must
be that kind of free and sels-conscious individuality(F1‘lrsiclz-
sein) which can properly be called personality. Only such a
being has capacity for revelation, or for that knowledge of God
which the sels-revealing Infinite Spirit produces in the finite
spirit. Only such a being has the capacity for receiving those
ethical and spiritual impressions and changes in which inspira-
