236 THE J 0 URNA L OF CHRI S T [Α Ν PHILOSOPHY.

We may, then, still further conclude, that the various faculties
of man are inspired according to the laws which belong to them,
in the service of ethical personality, and for the attainment of
ethico-religious ends. This principle might be illustrated‚ did
time permit, bya complete discussion under three divisionS, vi2.‚
Powers of Presentation, Powers of Representation and Reflec·
tion, Powers of Moral Discrimination and Choice. A few words
under each one of these heads must, however, suffice.

1. The Presentations of revelation may take place, either in
connection with some special activity of the senses, which the
subject of the activity ascribes to a special cause, or in the form
of an inward and more purely mental intuition of truth. In
some form, the primitive factor of revelation is an intuitione it
is the presentation before the mind of some object the presence
of which is ascribed to God as a cause. That the brain and
nervous system of man, his external and his inner organs of
sense, are susceptible of being used by the Divine Spirit as the
instrument of revelation, their use by the indwelling finite spirit
may suggest. Inspired dreamS, visionS, and prophetie ecstasy,
are not, then, contrary to the constitution of man: they may
rather be considered as analogous to the relations which exist
between the organism of the mind and both the mind and the
outside reality. The phenomena of inhibition and innervation
upon the central organs of sense plainly enough show that, not
only can the physical stimuli affect these organs from without,

’ but also the indwelling spirit from within. We are unable, in·

deed, in the case of such phenomena to distinguish, by means of
the phenomena themselveS, what must be considered purely
natural from what may be, in part, referred to a supernatural
agency. The ultimate test must lie in the nature of the truth
which is thus alleged to be revealed. But, on the other hand, to
deny that such physical and mental experiences can be inspired‚
is to go in the face of the plainest facts of daily experience.

The same general principle governs those presentations of reve· ι
lation which we characterize as the more inward and purely-

mental intuition of truth. In general, we cannot deny the truth-
fulness of Pfleiderer’s declaration: “ There arises not a single in-
tuition or image or cognition in υς, as the ready-made product
of an externalcause3 but what comes to us from without is only
