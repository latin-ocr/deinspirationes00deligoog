AN OUTLIN Ε HISTORIOAL STUDY. 101

21. Warrinqton.

GeO. Warrington quotes with approval in his treatise,¹ Arnold’s
statement that ‘ the faculties of an inspired man are left in their
natural state, except so far as regards the especial message with
which he is charged.'

Summing up the results of his investigatione of Scripture facts
and phenomena, he declares,

a. Inspiration does not extend to the letter, but is confined to
the spirit of the Bible.

b. The divine influence does not extend to statements regarded
as narratives' of matters of fact, but is confined to spiritual teach-
ing, the question of personal sentiments being left undecided. ’

c. There is no reason to regard any portion of this teaching as
uninspired, even when colored by personal or historical influences3
there is rather every reason to regard the whole as inspired.

22. Rom-tm Smiffi.

To most conservative scholars it can scarcely seem less than
absurd to speak of a theory of inspiration as held by Professor
Robertson Smith. Yet he professes to have such a theory, and
that the only correct one. He declares it consistent with the
Westminster standards‚ and variant only from their traditional
interpretation. It is rather incidentally developed than explicitly
stated in his answer to the libel brought against him in due course
of ecclesiastical procedure, and in his volume, ‘The Old Testament
in the Jewish Ohurch.’ It can really be deduced only from a
summary of the results of his destructive work upon the Jewish
canon. The design and limits of this article forbid the attempt
to present such a resume.

A few apparently clear conclusions, however, may be deduced.
He professes to find both a divine and a human clement in the
Bible. The latter, the larger of the two, furnishes a fair field for
the application of the principles of historica] criticism. It is not
only right, but imperatively necessary, that all parts of the Script-
ures wherein this element is controfflng, be subjected to precisely
the same critical tests and treatment as are applied to literary
works in general. Opinions will necessarily vary as to how much
can remain of a particular passage or book after Mr. Smith has
