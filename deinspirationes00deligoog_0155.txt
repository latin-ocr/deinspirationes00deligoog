Brahmanas (commentaries on the ancient Vedic sacrificial rites
and the hymns therewith connected), but to no other Hindu
writings.

Ii. The Buddhistic.

’ Buddhism ⁴can be properly understood only when viewed as a
reaction against Brahmanism. Properly speaking, it is not a
religion at all, for it has no real Deity3 it is rather a metaphysical
philosophy,-—a system, not revealed, but discovered by a man,
Gautama. Even after the sage attained the final truth, becoming
Buddha, the Enlightened, hc left 111 his gospel of annihilation no
room for nature, much less for the supernatural.

Buddhism began by denying the authenticity and revealed ’

character of the VedaS, but yet went on to develop an immense
sacred canon of its own (two hundred and twenty-five folio vol-
nmes), for which, however, it dare make no claim of divine
origin, or any sort of inspiration whatever. For our purposeS,
therefore, the system of Sakya-Mouni‚ though in form a book-
religion, may be left out of the account.

111. The Zoroastrian.

Tradition among the Parsis ascribes the immediate and exclu-
sive authorship of the whole Zend-Avesta to Ahura-Mazda, who
delivered it complete to Zoroaster, that he might publish its
contents among men.

The sacred books themselves, however, as now extant, make no
such lofty assertions on their own behalf. The Yaena, not the
Vendidad, according to Haug, does claim to be a divine revela-
tion, but not in such a sense as to imply pure passivity on the
part of the human organ. Zoroaster is admitted to immediate
intercourse with the Deity, plies him with questions on every
subject of great interest and moment, and receives full and trust-
worthy replieS, which he makes known to his immediate follow·
ers and to mankind in general.

Itis highly probable that Zoroaster committed none of his
doctrines to writing. Like the Vedic hymm, they were trans-
mitted through many centuries by oral tradition alone. The
first penmen in each case are of necessity unknown.
