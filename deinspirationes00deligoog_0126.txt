old Greek manuscript entitled “Synodikon,” whichwas written
by some old romancer down in the dark ages, about the year
90ος for it relates things which occurred as late as 869, or five
hundred years after the Council of Nice was dead and buried.
And this story, written nobody knows when, where, or by whom,
has been swallowed, believed, and published by infidels far and
near, as an account of the origin of the New Testament3 and the
men who believe and peddle such fables call Christians fools for
believing the Bible.

thirty volumes, containing about twelve thousand peges of the
writings of different Christian authors who wrote before A.'D.
