practical activities of religion. Revelation is, then, a divine
work which is regarded as taking place in the faculties of knowl-
edge, and as resultingsin the making known of truth to its
recipient. Inspiration relates to all the faculties of man, and
emphasizes especially the ethical faculties of saith and sels-sur-
render. But, inasmuch as the Holy Spirit is the personal prin-
ciple of all truth, and especially of all truth concerning God as
the Redeemer and concerning his work in the Kingdom of
Redemption, to have this Spirit is to be inspired with insight
into the truth. b. The word revelation lays emphasis upon a
product rather than upon a· process considered as a kind of
recipiency, or activity, of the human mind. The process of
revelation issues in something made known. But the process
of inspiration is not spoken of as leaving a concrete objective
product, which may itself be called an inspiration‚ The word
inspiration lays the emphasis upon the manner in which the
human faculties operate. But, as soon as we introduce the idea
of the final purpose of inspiration‚ we are apt to be brought
around again to the idea of revelation. ‘⁴ Inspiration according
to the biblical conceptions‚” says Ackermann, “is to be thought
of as a vivifying and animating influence upon the spiritual
nature ‚of man, by which its activity and susceptibility are extra-

its circle of vision, and be dark and concealed, appears clear to
the inner power of perception, as though made its subject and
content.” c. Once more, revelation lays emphasis upon the
permanent and organic factors in the spiritual process Inspira-
tion, regarded merely as a certain state or activity of the human
faculties under divine spiritual influence, does not necessarily
produce an abiding word of God. In the more general sense
of the term inspiration—-a sense, however, perfectly well author-
ized by abundant biblical usage—every human spirit is inspired
whenever it enters into any communion with the Spirit of God.
The human spirit cannot go out of itself in order to commune
with the Divine Spirit. It carries within itself neither the inde-
pendent impulse nor the independent power to exercise such
communion. There can be such spiritual communion onlywhen
the Divine Spirit moves upon the human spirit so as to reveal
within it the divine presence. For this reason, inspiration is a
