French rationalism, in the persons of Edmund Scherer, Colani
and other writers in the “Revue de Theologie,” has asserted
German freedom of investigation.

VI. opinion in England.

We have seen that the evangelie orthodoxy of Germany has
not yet recovered from the blighting effects of the rationalistic
reaction of the eighteenth century against the dogmatic exaggera-
tions and absurdities of the seventeenth. It is but fair then to
notice that in Great Britain and America a counter-revolution set
in against previously prevailing latitudinarianism, in favor of
higher, stricter and more churchly views concerning the divine
origin and character of the IIoly Scriptures. The doctrine of the
plenary inspiration and infallible authority of the Bible has had
during the present century a long line of champions, all of whom
with pious intent, and not a few with learning and acuteness, have
defended what was to them the cause of truth, and foundation of
tshe ‘faith once delivered.’ The reader will at once recall the
names of many distinguished writers, whose works are in every
reference lib‘rary, and some of them the companion of every pas-

tor in his study.
To attempt to sketch these views, set forth often in extended

monographs, would be impossible and useless, especially as this
sketch is not intended for the defense of imperilled orthodoxy.
The historic interest may be best served by noting chiefly the .
deviatiom from generally received opinions, among writers and
scholars of varying schools of thought.

This divine († 1805) says: “ The doctrines came to the apostles
by revelation. They were wont to illustrate, support and enforce
them by such analogieS, arguments and considerations as 'their
own thoughts suggested.

“ The doctrine must be received, but it is not necessary, in order
to defend Christianity, to maintain the propriety of every coln-
parison, or the validity of every argument which an apostle has ’
brought into the discussion.'’ ¹
