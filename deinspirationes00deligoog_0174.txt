derived strictly and immediately from divine revelation.‘¹ [This
is one of the points on which, as above indicated, there seems
to have been some wavcring in Origen's own mind.] He also
ranks Paul one degree higher than Timothy and Luke‚ and

This is a most important question in connection with the ante-

in general, but (if we may deduce h'is general view from one

: special passage), to have held that the Holy Spirit selected the

words from special foresight of the needs of future ages„ Thus
he remarks: ‘⁶ Matthew might certainly have said (in the begin-
