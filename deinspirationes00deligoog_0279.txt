impressione, modes of our excitation‚ which are first wrought up
into definite intuitione„ imageS‚ etc„ by the activity of our spirit
in conformity with its laWS.” In the case of all the ordinary
impressione of sense, the object which the mind perceives is not
produced by the combination of merely physical elementS. It
is made up by the mind in accordance with the laws of its own
activity, but as conditioned upon the way in which the mind is
excited by the activity of the bodily organs, In the case, then,
of the so-called prophetie vision, the presentation of the senses
can be regarded only as means to an end. The senses of the
prophets are touched in order that some inner intuition of moral
and religious truth may take place. But even in the case where
the intuition does not appear as connected with some marked
excitement of the bodily organs, it cannot be regarded as some-
thing manufactured outside of the mind, and then imported into
it, as it were, from without. The intuition can arise only by the
activity of the mind’s self, in accordance with its own law3. As
an intuition, then, it brings with it its own verification. The in-

tion brings with itself its own guaranty. But every intuition
may be accompanied by aconviction as to its own cause. The
intuitions of revelation are by their subject ascribed intuitively
to the Divine Spirit as their cause. They are not known as the
mere result of the normal working of the human facultie33 but
they are accompanied by the conviction that God is their
cause. The Divine Spirit has wrought within my spirit so that
Ι see, with a clear inner intuition, his truth—such is the persua-
sion of the inspired soul.

2. But the faculties of Representation and Reflection are also
involved in the spiritual transactions which we call revelation
and inspiration. Without memory, imagination, and reasoning‚
revelation cannot take place. The inspiration which is the sub-
jective condition of revelation oporates within these faculties also,
That imagination, as the creative faculty in man, is unusually
active and elevated under inspiration, accords with all the phe-
nomena and the universal belief of the wisest minds. It may
be regarded as that formative energy which combines and brings
before the soul the elements of every form of intuition. The
