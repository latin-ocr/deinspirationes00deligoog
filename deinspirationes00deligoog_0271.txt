lations to the great historical work of th'e Divine Spirit special
and unique. The spiritual process which has accompanied the
process of historical revelation, as its subjective condition and
coi-relate, and which carne to its culmination in Christ and in
the founding of the Christian Church, has produced the Word
of God. This Word of God, scripturally fixed in the biblical
writings, is therefore entitled to be called, in a specific meaning
of the termS, theopneustic, or inspired. It may be ascribed in
a special and unique way to the inspiration of the Holy Spirit,
because it is the result of a process of revelation and inspiration
wrought by this Spirit for the redemption of mankind.

After these preliminary remarks we are the better prepared
to consider the nature of inspiration as a transaction in which
two spiritual -personalities are involved. God is a Spirit3 and
man is made a spirit i‘n the image of God. Hence the possi..
bility of a communication of the divine life m human moral and
religious self- consciousness 3——the possibility of revelation and
spiritual communion of man with God.

The Bible ascribes manifold activities to God as Spirit. The
conception of God as Creator and Lord of life is⁶ mediated in
a general way, according to the Old Testament, by the concep-
tion of his Spirit. The Spirit hovers over the waters at crea-
tion, is the source of life and the immanent cause of its continu-
ance in both man and beast. In man this Spirit becomes a spirit of
courage in battle, cunning in workmanship, skill in poetry, song,
and the interpretation of dreams, wisdom in counsel, rulership,
and judgment in a king. More especially is the Spirit of
Jehovah represented as the source of an ethically right spirit in
man: it is a spirit of holineSS. It is the medium through which
the prophet receives his communications from God, the vehicle
of divine revelation. A certain diffusiveness belongs to its very
nature3 it is shed abroad, imparted unto, poured out upon, the
minds and hearts of men and of communities. This diffusive-
ness abounds to the advantage of the entire theocratic com-
munity3 but the joy of Hebrew prediction is in the thought
that in coming time the fulness of the gift shall extend to all
classeS, grades, and members of the religious community, in a
more marvellous way.

The same God whom Jesus at one time presents as ὁ ξῶν
