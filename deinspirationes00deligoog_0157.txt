AN OUTLINE HISTORICAL STUDY. 5

momentS, but in fits of ecstasy. The appearance of his person
at sueh times was repulsive, terrible. “ He roared like a camel 3
his eyes rolled and glowed like red eoaIS, and on the eoldest day
terrible perspiration would break out all over his body. When
the terror eeased, it seemed to him as if he had heard bells ring-
ing, ‘ the sound whereof seemed to rend him to pieeeS,’—as if he
had heard the voice of a man,-—as if he had seen Gabriel,——or as
if words had been written in his laeassrtffss When the paroxysm
was over and eonsciousness returned, then, and not before, did
Mohammed begin to dietate to scribes that which he had heard
in the state of ecstasy.

The prophet was a vietim of epilepsy, but no diagnosis of this
¹ disease could explain all these symptoms with their attendant
results They seemed' intelligible only as signs of the veritable
prophetie frenzy. Thus classic paganism would have interpreted
them, and it was quite natural that the religious credulity of the
seventh century should do the same.

Turn now to the Koran. It purports to be a direct revelation
from Grod in the highest sense. The inner consciousness of the
prophet is not elevated and illumined with celestia] light3 rather
is the human element driven from every nook andhiding place,
while the divine element is sole and supreme. Every word
individually, from the beginning to the end, is the direct utter-
anee of Anah. ‘⁶ The formula, ‘ Speak, thus saith the Lord,’
either precedes every single sentence, or must be so understood.’'

It is to be observed that this extreme and artificia] theory of
inspiration is not, as in the ease of the Vedas and the Zend-
Avesta, a gradual growth of ages, but rather an original claim made
by Mohammed himself. When demand is now made for some
miraculous sign of his prophetie mission and authority, Mussul-
mans appeal to the Koran itself as the most stupendous of all
miracles. It is eternal and unereated, being first written in the
highest heavens, but carried by Gabriel to the lowest heaven,
and thence at intervals made known to the prophet. As the
immediate handiwork of God, it is faultless in style and inimi-
table in its beauty, but is for this very reason untranslatable into
foreign tongues, Thedoetrine of inspiration could no farther
ge. It would be interesting, but is perhaps impossible to know,
