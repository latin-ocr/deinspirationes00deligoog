232 THE JoURNAL OF CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHY.

a life which reaches through the things of sense and time: he
can call God F ather, and himself be called, not simply a creature,
but also a child, of God. In Christianity, the life which effects
changes in the entire nature of man is imparted t0, and lodged
in, the spirit of man. The New Testament anthropology pre-
pares the way for the doctrine of inspiration: it is theopneustic
throughout. The possession by man of a spirit, and the realizing
of his destiny by having his spirit possessed by the Divine Spirit,
gives to the communion of God with man, both its psychological
ground and its actual existence. Even the difference of rela-
tions between man and God which is shown by the teachings of
the Old Testament and those of the NeW, has been summarized
by Zezschwitz in the contrast between the two Greek words
πνευματαφόρος and πνευματικόςε in the Old Testament, the
nation as a whole, and especially in the person of certain selected
members of the theocratic community, is made the bearer, or
recipient, of spiritual influences, while in the New Testament the
Spirit so dwells in the individual member of the religious com—

munity as to become united, as it were, with lule-spirit, and so
man becomes spiritual. It is, then, as himself a spirit that man
can so receive the Divine Spirit as to be inspired. In other
wordS, the possession and exercise of a spiritual constitution is
a necessary condition of inspiration.

As the steadfast law, or limiting condition, of inspiration, we
may, then, announce the following: Since the contents of reve-
lation must become the contents of human consciousneSS, the
laws of the human consciousness furnish the necessary conditions
of inspiration. We cannot, indeed, deduce the contents of reve--
lation from the evolution, or necessary working, of the human
consciousness, This would be to make revelation nothing more
than the natural working of the human faculties3 and this would
be to deny the reality both of revelation and inspiration. But,
on the other hand, there can be no revelation accomplished
which is not within a mind3 and whatever is revealed to mind
must be known in accordance with the laws of human conscious5
neSS. We may argue this conclusion from the general analogy
of the divine operations: In the revelation of his truth, and in
his inspiration of his prophet, God will respect the constitution
of the mind and heart which He has himself bestowed. We have
