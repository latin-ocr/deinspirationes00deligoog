18 THE DOCTRINE 01³· mstAnonz

the penmen was essential as a gua-rantee of the supernatural·
character of the prophecies aud other Scriptures.

Representatives ,of the former opinion were found chiefly
among the ApologistS.

J ustin Martyr‘ speaks of the divine plectrum itself descending
from heaven, and using righteous men like a harp or lyre.¹

Again: ‘⁶ When you hear the utterances of the apostles,
spoken as it were personally, you must not suppose that they
are spoken by the inspired themselves, but by the divine Word
who moves them.'’²

Athenagoras employs a figure similar to that of J ustin, saying:
“ The Spirit made use o'f the prophete, as a flute-player breathes
into a flute.”³

He also describes the condition of those who were under the
influence of inspiration, as a condition of ecstasy. ‘⁶ Moses,
Isaiah, J eremiah and other prophete, lifted in ecstasy above the
natural operatione of their own mindS, by the impulses of· the
divine spirit, uttered the things-with which they were inspired.”⁴

Theophilus similarly calls the sacred writers ‘ instrumente,
organs of God.’ .„ ἱ

The use of the figure of musical instruments in this connection
was probably borrowed from Philo, and shows that as his mind
was impregnated with heathen notione ¹concerning the nature
and process of inspiration, so the minds of most of the Apolo-
gists were tainted with the same. This indeed seems natural,
when we remember that they were trained in heathenism, and
. that their first knowledge of Christian truth was not the result ,
of logical thought, but was referred solely to revelation and the
action of the spirit of God. The whole conception could not
'fail to receive powerful impression from traditional habits of
thought respecting the Sibyls, the Pythian priestess and other ·
seers and soothsayers of antiquity. The evidence here is cumu-
lative, and cannot be given in detail, but will repay careful study,⁵
provided only it be constantly borne in mind that the idea of
