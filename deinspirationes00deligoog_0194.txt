Calvin calls God ‘the author of the Scriptures,' notes their
divine lnajesty, aud speaks of the Holy Spirit who ⁶ uttered his
voice by the mouth of the prophets.' He attributes to the sacred
records the same authority as though the ‘living words of God
were heard from heaven 3' aud yet unhesitatingly concedes slight
inaccuracies and errors, e. g., in citations (Matt. 27 : 9). He also
acknowledges the human element in the biblical writerS, espec-

by such the Holy spirit wished to show that eloquence was not

wanting to him, while elsewhere he made use of a rough and un- ’

couth st le.”
Calvhir confessed to certain critical scruples concerning the
canonicity of the Second Epistle of Peter.

the writers were also led by treacherous memories into the com-
mission of mistakeS.''

V11. Remarks on Apparent Inconsistencies in the At-
titude of the Reformers toward the Scriptures.

It is difficult to study the writings of the reformers without
gaining the impression that their attitude toward the Holy Scrip-
tures was in some sense anomalous and inconsistent. On the one
hand, they declare them to be of divine origin, the word of God,
the sole source and standard of all religious saith and practice,
and, apart from tradition, themselves alone sufficient for s'alva-
tion. On the other hand, some of the reformers· at least allow
themselves such freedom in the expression 'of critical opinion as
seems incompatible with belief in the really supernatural in-
spiration of the Scriptures, their infallible truth and authorita-
’ tiveness in the entire range of their contenta The apparent dis-
