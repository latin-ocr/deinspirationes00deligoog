H. THE DOCTRINE OF INSPIRATION DURING
THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.

The ultra-orthodox doctrine of inspiration a-ffirmed by the Lu-
theran and Reformed scholastice of the seventeenth century was
during the succeeding on'e greatly modified and li1nited,—-in many
quarters, wholly abrogated. Some powerful specific agencies
were at work to produce these radica] changes, Among them
may be mentioned on the one side, the influence of Spinoza and
his philosophic system, as well as that of English Deism 3 on the
other, the rise of Pietism. Each contributed in its own way
and measure. But. more than this: the old theories seemed to
come in conflict with almost every aspect of the progressive
thought of the eighteenth century, and were outlawed by reason
of the difficulties and contradictions in which they involved their
advocateS, as well as by the positive advance in criticism, exe-
gesis and philosophy. The real attack on the strict Lutheran
doctrine began about the end of the seventeenth century,
and took two main directions, a historic and a philosophie. The
former concerned the doctrine of inspiration in general, and its
practical application to specific books and passages3 the latter ex—
tended to revelation as well as inspiration, and pai-took rather of
a philosophie and dogmatic character.¹ The one kind was de-
termined, as just indicated, by the progress both of criticism and
interpretation, as well as by that- of historic-al theology in general.
Most important here was Seinler, who really inaugurated the rev-
olutionary epoch in Germa-n theology.²

Attacks of the second sort were probably at least an indirect
result of the influence of the writings of Spinoza, while they
were greatly furthered by the aid of the Kantian philosophy and
its application to theology.⁸ Each in its way contributed power-
fully not only to the overthrow of old ideaS, but to the develop-
ment of a freer philosophical interpretation of the idea and theory
of inspiration,

As the result of the coworking of all influences there followed
a notable reconstruction of the doctrine. Henceforward inspira—
