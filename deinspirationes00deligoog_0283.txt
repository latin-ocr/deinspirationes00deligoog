Testament the bearer of universal religious truth to mankind.
The same spiritual life prepared the organs of the New Testa·
ment revelation which through them brought its eternal truths
to man. But the geniality of each mind, considered as receptive
of the new and universal ideaS, bears some pretty definite pro-
portion to the amount of such ideas sent into the world by each
mind. To these complex relations of the individual to his place
and work in the one great scheme of divine sels-revelation do we
owe in part the differences in type which belong to the different
views of the person of Christ and to the different presentations
of the one great Christian system of truthS. Under the same
principle must we also bring those minute differences which
concern the individual shadings and turns of thought and the
minuter differences of language—the style in the widest extent
of the term—which are shown in the oral or written expressions
of inspired mindS.

In general, we conclude, then, that the finite spirit, the second
personality in this personal transaction of revelation and inspi-
ration, furnishes the conditions which determine the mode in
which the Divine Spirit shall carry out within the human con-

pute in Protestant theology from the closeof the sixteenth to the
middle of the eighteenth centuries, we might properly give our-
selves no concern. It has to be considered rather as a matter of
historical interest than of dogmatic validity. With this so-called
“ old orthodoxy,'’ revelatzb, was the supernatural and immediate
making known, to the writers of the Bible‚ of things before un-
known. Inspiratz'o was the supernatural and immediate infusion
of thingS, both known and unknown, into the minds of the
authors of Sacred Scripture, in their act-of constructing the bib-
lical books, Revelation in this sense appertained‚ indeed, only
to the writers of Sacred Scripture, but it might take place either
before, or at the time of, their writing. Inspiration, in the spe-
cific sense, never took place except in connection with the com--
