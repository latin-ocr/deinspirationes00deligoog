AN OUTLINE HISTORICAL STUDY. ι 41

termined by the fact that in the Bible he found that rest from
doubt and disquiet of conscience which he sought in vain from
philosophy and scholasticism.

1. He held that the Scriptures are from God3 that they con-
tain the infallible revelation of his character and will, and form
the only and sufficient source of knowledge in matters of saith, as
well as an unerring rule in the conduct of daily life.

2. Like Luther, he seems to have conceded the existence 'of

· some distinction between the Scriptures and the word of God,
, finding the latter imbedded in the former like gold in the rock.

He admitted inaccuracies of historical statement in the Bible‚

and consequently could not predicate absolute infallibility of every ’

writer on every subject. His words are as follows: ‘⁶ It is not
true that the writings of all holy men are infallible3 nor is it true
that they do not err. This ρι’θὸιῃίῐιεῐιοθ must be given to the Son
of Grod alone, out of the whole human race)

This admission‚ however, did not interfere with the exalted
estimate which he placed upon the Bible‚ or with the unique po—
sition which he assigned to it..

3. He denied the canonicity of the Apocalypse.

Calvin's views of inspiration were much stricter than those of
either Luther or Zwingle, as he maintained approximately what
is known as the ⁶ plenary theory.' To mention some specific dif-
ferences between Calvia and other reformers on the subject, we
note:

1. ·He did not, like otherS, distinguish the form from the sub-
stance of Christian truth‚ but extended the influence of inspira—
tion to both.

2. He refused to grant such free scope for the exercise of the
critical spirit as Luther had done.

3. He gave preference to the for-mal over the material princi-
ple of the Reformation‚ i. e., dwelt more on the authority and
sufficiency of the Scriptures than on the doctrine of justification
by saith.

4. He extended the infallibility and authoritativeness of the
Scriptures not only to matters of doctrine, but also to those of
discipline and life. Hence his presbyterian church polity and
theocratic civil government for Geneva.
