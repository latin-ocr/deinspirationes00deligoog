The question as to the inspiration of the Bible is not a question
raisedb‘y me. It is a question that is already up for discussion
through the length and breadth of this land. What are we to
do with this book? How are we to regsrd it! Is it the best
book in the world, or the ποι-εΗ Is it a true book, or is it s
false ons? Is it God’s book, or is it man's book?

We find men on all sides of the question. There are persons
who tell us this book is a good book—but then, there ars others
just ss good.. The Bible is inspired, and so was Plato inspired,
so was Socrates, and so is the almanno inspired3 in fact, every·
thing is inspired—the book of Mormon, the Korsu of Mahomeg
the sacred books of tho Hindoos and the Chines03-theff hsssve
their Biblos, you have yours3 all are good, and one is about. as
good as the other. Shakespeare was inspirsd, Milton was in·
spired, Thomas Psine was inspired, and everything and every-
body is inspired.

Itis not worth while to waste time on false issues. When 1
open Shakespeare’s plays 1 do not read at the commenoement,
“Thus saith the Lord God of hosts ;” when 1 tum to Plato’s
writings 1 do not read, “Hear ye the word of the Lord;” when
1 perusa the almanso I do 'not read, “The word of the μνᾶ
came unto ms, saying,” thus and so. Hence, you ses that this
Book must be judged by a different 'standard from au other
