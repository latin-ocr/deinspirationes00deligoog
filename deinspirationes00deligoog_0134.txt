Suppose thatthirty or forty men should walk in through that ·

door. 0110 man comes from Maine, another from New Hamp-
shire, another from Massachusetts, and so on from each state,
each bearing a block of marble of peculiar shape. Suppose 1
pile up these blocks in order, until 1 have the figure of a man,
perfectly symmetrical and beautituuy chiseled, and 1 say, “How
did these men, who had never seen each other, chisel out that
beautiful statuev’· You say, “That is easily explained. One
man planned that whole statue, made the patterna, gave the
directions, distributed them around3 and so, each man working
by the pattern, the work fits accurately when completed. '³ Very
well. Here is a book coming from all quarters, written by men
of all classes, scattered through a period of fifteen hundred
years3 and yet this book is fitted together as a wondrous and
harmonicus whole. How was it done? “Holy men of God
spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.” One mimi in-

voice of God speaking with resurrection power.

Again, I conclude that this Book has in it the very breath of
God, from the effect that it produces upon men. There are men
who study philosophy, astronomy, geology, geography, and
mathematica, but did you ever hear a man say, “I was an out-
cast, a wretched inebriate, a disgrace to my race, and a nuisance
in the world, until 1 began to study mathematica, and learned the
multiplicatiori table, and then turned my attention to geology,
got me a little hammer, and knocked off the cornera of the
rocks and studied the formation of the earth3 but since that
time Ι have been happy as the day is long, 1 feel like singing

· all the time, my soul is full of triumph and pesce3 and health

and blesmng have come to my desolate home 01100 111010.” Did
you ever hear a man ascribe his redemption and salvation from
intemperance and sin and vice to the multiplicatiori table, or the
science of mathematica or geology? But 1 can bring you, not
one man, 01· two, or ten, but men by the thousand who will teu
you, “1 was wretched, I was lost3 Ι broke my poor old mother’s
heart3 I beggared my family3 my wife was broken-hearted and
dejected3 my children fied from the sound of their father’s foot-
