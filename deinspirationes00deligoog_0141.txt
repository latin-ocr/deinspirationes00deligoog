The investigators of “ the mistakes of Moses'’ might well eon-
sider the system of sanitary seienoe embodied in Moses’ law, so
unlike anything which the world had ever seen, and which the
civilization of the nineteenth century is still too ignorant to ap-
prettiiate, though observem begin to note its results as indicated

If we take a thousand Jews and a thousand Gentiles, as a
basis of eomputation, we may divide them into four parts3 one-
fourth οἱ them eomprehendmg those who die in aaa· γεω-ες
one-hals, those who attain to middle zise,- and one2fowr , those
who reaoh αῶυαηωᾶ aye. But amon the Gentiles, the first two
hundred and fifty that die, will reae an average age of thyma-s
and eleven mmmm,- while among the Jews, the first uarter will
die at an average age of mentm-eiam ymo and t ee months.
Among the Gentiles the one-half who attain to middle aqu, will
die at an average age of money-eim vem-s and τίω mouth& among
the Jews the same portion will reaoh an average a e of fifty·
three yeoers and om mouth. Among the Gentiles, the t quwter,
who live longest, will die at an average age of fifbymine uem-s
and ten mouth-v while the same elass among the Jews will live
to an average age of mmby-‹me ymo.

Further, not only is the death rate less among “the seattered

nation,” but the birth rate is qnater. Dr. Pressel states that, in ,

his district, the number of J ewish births reached an annual aver·
a e offlswfioe per thousand, while the Gentile bitths were only
t ivry-eiqht per thousand; and the ecelesiastioal registers of Prus-
sia also show, that among one hundred thousand Gentile births
<me hundred and form-thu children were still-born, while among
