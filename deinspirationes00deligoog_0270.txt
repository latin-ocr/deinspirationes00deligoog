228 THE JOURNAL OF CHRISTJAN PHILOSOPHY.

corresponds to the classic Greek word νοῦς, reason, was devel-
oped from the physical and sensuous side. But this fact is not
to the detriment, it is rather to the immeasurable benefit of the
conception. A free and boundless divine energy enters into the
concrete affairs of every-day human life. It moulds nature on
man’s behalf. It moves upon and dwells within man for his
intellectual and moral quickening and purifying. It works all
things which require the indwelling presence and power of a
supernatural energy.

Hence the second characteristic of the biblical conception of
the Holy Spirit, viz. its manifoldness. How, indeed, could this
spiritual energy be effective in human history without being
manifold? If all the members of the great spiritual organism
were moved and moulded alike, where were the body? Artis-

foresight, true sense for the supernatural in nature and history,
moral purifying, knowledge of that hitherto hidden mystery
which Christ conveys and is ;—these are all, according to the
biblical conception, fruits of the manifold activity of that one
and the same Spirit. It is this manifoldness of the biblical con-
ception of the Divine Spirit, with its range and variety of applica-

opneustic o‘r inspired. We cannot, in faithfulness to historical
truth, consider all its portions as covered by this one predicate
in the same specific sense which belongs to some of them, or
indeed in any one sense. It is, in general, a theopneustic
book,—the fruit of this spiritual process which hasaccompanied
the objective and historical process of revelation.

3. Some more limited and specific conception of inspiration
is needed, i'f we are to speak of the relations which exist between
Spirit and Bible as in any way special and unique. That which
distinguishes the Bible from all other books is, indeed, not
solely, nor chiefly, its inspiration in the technical sense which
the old orthodoxy invented for the term. Its unique character
and peerless value do not depend upon its being, as to inspira-
tion, specifically distinct from all other written expressions of
divine truth. They depend rather upon its historical qualities
and historical position inthe divine seli-revelation of redemp-
tion. These qualities and this position, however, render its re-
