2. Ilseylcm.

M. Auguste Meylan, a Swiss Protestant pastor, published in
1877 a treatise on the Canonicity and Inspiration of the Scriptures·
His positions are, for a continental divine, on the whole decidedly
conservative. He defines inspiration as ‘ that action of God upon
the sacred writerS, which put them in a condition to receive the

revelation in its integrity, and transmit it to us without altera· .

tion) ¹

He disavows all sympathy with dictation theories, and allows a
human factor in the composition of the ScriptureS. He admits
progress in the course of divine revelation, and degrees in inspira-
tion, varying according to the requirements and circumstances of
the case. He even concedes contradictions in matters of minor
detail among the sacred narrativeS, but repudiates the consequences
of such concessione.

The author is unable to bring himself to the admission of the
distinctions, so generally recognized by continental writers upon
inspiration, between that element in the Bible which *stands in
relation to human salvation, and that which has no, connection
with it. Once, however, he seems to approximate the idea,
(p. 188.)

Μ. Meylan admits a difference of kv'snd, and not merely of
deqree between apostolic authors and Christian writers in general,
thus arraying himself against the the rationalistS, and allying him-
self with pronounced advocates of evangelica] orthodox opinions.

3. Godet.

Dr. Godet, professor at N euchatel, approving in general the
definition of inspiration given by Meylan, yet declares his co'n-
viction that the true light can be shed upon the circle of questions
relating thereto (perhaps the most difficult in all sacred science),
only .by a clear and frank admission of the distinction between
the Bible and the word of God. The Bible includes more than
the immediate revelation of God. It contains the word of God,
but is not identical with it.' Nothing can be more delicate than the
problems which grow out of this distinction, but the time has come
for the church to rise to the recognition of this important‘faot.²
