orthodoxy‚ however, asserted itself with vigor, not only against
RomanistS‚ but also against ArminianS, Socinians and MysticS.
The material here is so abundant as to forbid the presentation of
the views of individual theologiam in detail. It must be ar-
ranged under a few specific heads:

1. T he Nature qf Impiratv'on.

a. Authorship.

The theologians of this school taught that God is the only real
author of Scriptnre. ‚ As Quenstedt († 1688) says: “ God alone,
if we wish to speak accurately, should be called the author of sa·
cred Scripture.” Of the persons of the Trinity, it is the Holy

made use of the sacred penmen. He therefore is the primary
Author, they the secondary authors.¹

The relation of inspired men to the inspiring Spirit was con-

impulse to write, and in the process of writing itself, men could
rank only as ‘the pens or the amanuenses of the Holy Ghost.'²

Thus Gerhard (†1637) says: ‘⁶ The efficient, principal cause of
sacred Scripture is God3 the instrumenta] causes were holy men. ‘
They wrote not as men, but as men of God3 i. e., servant-s of
God and special organs of the Holy Ghost.” ⁸

Again: ‘⁶ One may rightly call the apostles and prophets aman·
nenses of God, hands of Christ, and notaries or secretaries of the
Holy Ghost, since they spoke or wrote nothing according to their'
own human will. All therefore was suggested and inspired with-

the state of passivity in which the sacred writers fulfilled their
functions, and says that they wrote nothing ‘ out of their own
‚understanding, but all things under the direction of the Holy
Ghost.'

The Lutheran divines conceived it as quite natural that in con· ,
sidering the origin of any particular book of Scripture‚ the sec-
