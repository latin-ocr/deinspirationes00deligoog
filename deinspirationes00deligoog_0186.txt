X. Forerunners of the Reformation.

It is to those who are usually called ‘ forerunners of the
Reformation ' that we naturally look for the fullest, clearest and
loftiest ideas of inspiration possible to this age. But our ex-
pectations are only partially realized.

1. Wielzf.

We search the writings of Wiclif (†1384) in vain for any extended
formal discussion of the subject, though he published a treatise,
“Of the T ruth of Holy Scriptura) Bred to scholastic habits of
thought, and to the acceptance of prevalent views respecting
the two-fold source of Christian knowledge in reason and authority
(which latter, nominally including Scripture, really meant eccle'-

siastical tradition), the reformer could work his way but slowly

decisive divine authorityof Scripture. He says that Scripture ‘ is ,

the word of God ³—that ‘ it is the will and testament of God the
Father, which cannot be broken ’—and yet again that ‘ God and
his word are one, and cannot be separated the one from the other’.¹
He declares Christ to be the proper author of scripture, and in-
fers from this fact its absolute authority. As Christ is infi-
nitely superior to every other man, so is the book which is his law
to every other writing which can be, named.2 He makes the
Bible the supreme standard by which even the doctrines of the
church-fathers are to be tried.

While missing, then, in Wiclif all abstract discussions of the

question of inspiration, especially theorizings as to its nature or,

extent, we do see his ardent belief in thefaot brought out, and
the general complexion of his views We are really at no loss to
η know where he stood.

2. Sasvonarola.

Savonarola († 1495) was orthodox in reference to our doctrine
according to the idea of his time, though his opinions had a de-
