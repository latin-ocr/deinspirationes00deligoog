spirit, between God and the world, is as mysterious surely as
that of the relation between finite spirit and Infinite Spirit.

1 1. In inspiration, the content of the inspired consciousness
is primarily ethico-religiouS. It is an object of revelation which
is always primarily ethico-religiouS.

12. Inspiration, as the subjective condition of‚bib1ica1 reve·-
lation and the predicate of the Word of God, is speczfically the
same illumining, quickening, elevating, and purifying work of
the Holy Spirit as that which goes on in the persons of the en-

tire believing community. Biblical inspiration as a predicate of “

the Word of God is specifically that divine spiritual activity
within man which is the subjective condition of the biblical reve-
lation. That which distinguishes the authors of Sacred Scrip-
ture from the other members of this community is more im-
portant, and, historically considered, more fundamental, than a
difference in the kind of their mental and moral illumining. It
is chiefly their unique position, as determined by the divine
plan, with respect to the historica} process of the divine sels-
revelation in redemption. By this position they are divinely
constituted the guides and founders of the religious community.

13. But finally, arnong the various criteria of inspiration, the
ones which are preeminent and final are found in its product of
revealed truth as tested by the abiding and yet unfolding relig-
ious consciousness of the believing community. It is where the
Bible and the present witness of the Holy Spirit coincide, where
the word objective is met by the word subjective, that the realm
of most assured truth is found. For, the ever-living Church of
God both builds her saith and life upon the ever-living Word of
God, and also discernS, testS, applieS, and defends it.
