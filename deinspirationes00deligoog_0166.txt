collection of Christ-ian sacred writings‚ however, had yet been
made3 and consequently the precise relation of those already
known and used, to the Old Testament Scriptures was not defi·
nitely settled in the consciousness of the Church. Certainly
⁸ the formulated theory of J'ewish inspiration was not at the out-
set applied to them. This application, however, was speedily
made, and several things conspired to effect it. One was‘ the
habit of reading sections from the writings of the prophete and

apostles in the public assemblies of the Christians.¹ Equal dignity ,

seemed thus to be ascribed to both. Then, again, careful scrutiny
disclosed the indissoluble internal connection and unity of both:
the one, as containing the predictions of the Messiah and his
mission of salvation3 the other, as proclaiming his actual advent,
andthe completion of his redeeming work. “

“ Witness as to the belief of the church in the common divine
origin and character of both classes of sacred books is abundant,
clear and decisive.

Thus ,J nstin (ψ 163) says: ‘⁶ We have believed God’s voice,
spoken again· by the apostles of Christ, and proclaimed by the
prophete.’'² ⁶

Theophilus: ‘⁶ Concerning the righteousness which the Law ,
enjoined, confirmatory utterances are found, both within the
Prophets and in the Grospels, because they all spoke inspired by

one Spirit of G0d.”³
’ Yet more distinctly, Irenaeus († 202) :³ “For the one and same
Spirit os God, who proclaimed by the prophets what and of what
sort the advent of the Lord should be, announced also that the
fulness of the times had come.”4

Of Tertullian († cir. 230), an old German, writer says: “His
whole theory is summed up in these two propositione : ‘ The Old
and N ew Testaments are inspired3 and, both collectione of writ-

‚ ings are inspired shy one and the same God.’ This he proves in ·

detail, in his treatise ‘Against Marcion,’ especially Chapters
X1x., xxv.
