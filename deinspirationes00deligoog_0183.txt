V. Anselm.

Anselm‚ Archbishop of Canterbury († 1109) indulged in no
sceptical questionings of the orthodox theory of inspiration, but
set himself to give a rational account of the contents of his fait-h
· concerning it. He devoted whole nights to the consideration of
*various intricate questions connected with the dogma, especially
how the prophets could view the future as present. By a broad
generalization from a kind of vision in which he was enabled to
look through a stone wall and see the monks celebrating mass,
he concluded that as space had been annihilated for him, so the
other dimension was done away for the prophets under inspiration.
Things to come were revealed to them as present.

This method of argumentation certainly possessed the method
of oriqinality, if no other excellence.

VI. Abelard.

Abelard’s († 1142) whole conception of the doctrine of inspira-
tion was very loose. In the introduction to his Sic et N on,
he explicitly denied that prophets and apostles were infallible.¹
He distinguished degrees in the bestowment of the divine in-
fluence, and held that the prophets did not always speak under
the impulse of the spirit, even when they thought they did. ⁹
They were allowed to mingle truth with error, and the natural
with the supernatural‚ in order to keep them humble, and lead
them to discriminate more carefully between their own utterances
and those proceeding from the spirit of God.

’ V11. Thomas Aquinas.

Thomas († 1274) expresses himself upon the question
of inspiration with more fnlness‚ precision and clearness
than is usual with the Scholastics. He makes God the author
of scripture, -but like Abelard admits degrees in the divine
infinence exerted upon the sacred writers. He distinguishes
express revelation from an instinct which the human mind may
possess sometimes unconsciously. This divine instinct is a lower
degree of inspiration than prophetie certainty.² Thomas also
