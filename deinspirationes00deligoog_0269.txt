JNSPJRA TJON. 22 7

phrase ὁ νοῦς τοῦ Θεοῦ, tlze reason of God, would scarcely
conform to the biblical conception or usage.

Without attempting to explicate the more exact meanings “

which areDconcealed in such a use of terms, we need only re-
mark this: The fundamental conception of a divine spirit is
that of a personal and sels-communicating energy; God, re-
garded and known as revealing and communicating himself in
history, as Spirit. 'The conception is peculiarly biblical. Not
even Plato seemed able to conceive of a divine spiritual energy
as giving force and law and goal to the history of the world.
The conception itself implies such insight into the supernatura]
presence and force of sacred history as can come only through
revelation and inspiration. .The idea of a Holy Spirit, as pre-
sented in the Bible, brings God before us in the form of a per-
sonal energy who penetrates and moulds the entire historic
process of redemption. The corresponding subjective process
is then fitly called inspiration, and referred to the same personal
and spiritual energy.

2. The two characteristics of sensuousness and manifoldness “
belong to the biblical conception of a Holy Spirit. What 1
have ventured to call the characteristic of sensuousness belongs
preeminently to the Old Testament representation& By this
characteristic the spiritual energy of Jehovah is b'rought into
definite relations with the concrete existences and concrete facts

. of history. It is especially opposed to that cold deistic notion

of God’s* being and activities which gives him no place in human
passion ⁴ or human art; and which regards the world as a
machine rather than as an organism interpenetrated, filled and
moved with divine spiritual life. This conception is, as Acker-
mann has said, that of some kind of perpetuum mobile. It can-
not, however, be properly represented under the thin and evan-
escent terms of much so-called theology. But we agree with
the author just quoted in the opinion : “ It is more than prob-
able that the Indians in North America, when they pray to the
Grenat Spirit, conceive by this of something more sensible and
more alive than many of our preachers and writers of religious
books, when they with great pathos style God a Spirit.”

It is simple truth of criticism that the conception which cor-
responds to the biblical word πνεῦμα, spirit, like that which
