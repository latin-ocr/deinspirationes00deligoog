11. Luther.

. The general attitude of Luther on the subject of inspiration
was that of freedom, though in matters of detail it must be con-
· fessed that he stands in dogmatic contradiction with himself. All
becomes clear only upon cai-eful consideration, both of thc man
himself in his personal character and experience, and of the
theologiau, especially his views‘ on the general doctrine of the
Scriptures. This lies beyond our present purpose. We can at-
tempt only the briefest outline of the subject immediately in
question. ‘

1. Luther calls the Bible ‘ the greatest and best book of God,’
sees in it the ‘living truth of the Holy Spirit,’ and exalts it as
‘the only source of knowledge of the pure apostolic word,’ and

power, secured in the minds of the biblical writers all needful
knowledge of divine truth, but this truth took on a human form,
and thus became their inward personal possession. These writers
made use of their own faculties in the attaininent of historical

divine light by the power of the illuminating Spirit working in
them.’ ¹ Thus Luther calls the books of MoseS‚ ⁶ writings of the
Holy Ghost,' while he supposes that the legislator derived his
laws from the traditional customs of the fathers of the J ewish
nation. Of the prophetS, he says: “ Doubtless the prophets
studied MoseS,'and the later prophets studied the earlier ones, and
wrote down in a book their good thoughts inspired by· the Holy
Ghost.”

All this goes to show that Luther entertained no mechanical view
of inspiration, but held that the Holy Ghost made use of the hu-
man individuality of the Scripture writers as his free organS.²

erence to the Scripturas, and demanded that it exercise the critical
