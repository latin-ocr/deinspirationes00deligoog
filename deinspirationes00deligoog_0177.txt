1. The Nature of Inspiration.

In general throughout this long period, though perhaps more
especially at its beginning and its close, ideas on this subject were
strict—-frequently exaggerated, sometimes utterly inconsistent.
We notice—- -

1. That the theologians of the N icene age inherited from their
predecessors a tendency to emphasize strongly the difference be-
tween the inspiration of heathenism and that of their own sacred
books. Eusebius attempted to set forth and explain the points
of difference. A summary of his statements is given from an

old German writer.

⁴ a. The oracular responses are absurd, immoral and impious,both
in themselves and in the practical results to which they lead in
human life. On the other hand, men who ‘ speak as moved
by the Holy Ghost,' ‘dissuade from idolatry and heathen crimeS,
and reveal Christ, the great Teacher and Redeemer.

b. Demoniac influence darkens the mind, and deprives it of the
use of reason, so that the inspired appear frantic. The divine
Spirit, on the other hand, who is himself the purest light, illu-
mines the soul, and thus fits it for the apprehension of super-
sensuous things. The inspired r'emain sober and awake, under·
stand and pass judgment on the things they utter.

c. Heathen oracles are made known through unworthy men or
through animals3 God‘s Spirit, on the other hand, honors only
such men with his influence as have rendered themselves fit for
the same by the practice of virtue.

2. It is clear, without further illustration, that the church held
rigidly for a considerable period to the idea, so emphasized by
Origen and others, of the elevatiora and abomination, not the
mwression of the human conscionsness of the person under
divine influence.

3. Quite inconsistently, there was still a strong tendency among
most of the N icene and later fathers to make the sacred writers
the mere instruments of the Holy Spirit, who is the sole author
of Scripture, even in the process of recording.
