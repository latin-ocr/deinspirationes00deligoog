intelligence is enthralled by sleep, or he 1s demented by some ·
distemper or possession. And he who would understand what he'
remembers to have bee 1 said, whether he was in dream, or when
he was awake, by the prophetie and enthusiastic nature, or what
he has seen, must recover his senseS.”¹

There were others, however, who took a different and a higher
view. Plutarch„f0r example, excused the bad poetry with which
sceptical ridicule charged the Pythian priestess, and yet main-
tained its inspiration by asserting that the deity made use ot' her
imperfect natural faculties for conveying and embodying his
own infallible truth. Here he clearly distinguishes two elements
and factors in inspiration, a divine and a human, and seeks by
attributing to each its proper share in the complex product, to
avoid either extreme, credulity or unbelief.

He says: “ We are not to believe that the god made the verses· ,
but, after he has communicated the moving impulse, each of the
prophetesses is moved in a way that corresponds to her own
peculiar nature. For let us suppose that the oracles were not to
be spoken, but recorded in writing, we should not, Ι imagine,
ascribe to the god the strokes of the lettere, and find fault with
him because the writing was not so beautiful as that of the impe-
rial edicts. Not the language, nor the tone, nor the expression,
nor the measure of the verse comes from the god—all this· comes
from the woman. He simply communicates the intuitione, and
kindles up a light in the soul with regard to the future.'’² More
to ‘the same purport might be quoted.

General conclusion&

Enou h has probably now been said respecting extra-Christian
views ofinspiration. We see that the idea exists in various forms
and degrees, and shall find that it exerted, in its Platonic form,
much influence upon Alexandrian Judaism, and thus mediately
at least upon Christianity.

Two things at this stage of our inquiries demand notice.

1. It is not true, without exception, as commonly supposed,
that heathen inspiration acknowledges but ohe factor, the divine,
