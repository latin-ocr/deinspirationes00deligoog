tion essentially consistS. In the higher use of the word, itis
only spirits that can be inspired. The constitution of man, as
the subject of revelation and inspiration, must be considered,
then, as giving certain necessary conditions to‘ both those his-
torical and spiritual processes of which we have already spoken,
For the Word of God is not simply from God to man; it is
known to be from God only as it is in man3 it has no reality
except as it is wrought out in the human mind and in human
history. The conditions of this word must, then, come from
the constitution of that being within whom, by the activity of
the powers belonging to him, it is inspired.

The central and controlling element of such a conception of
man as shall make him the fit subject of revelation and inspira-
tionis to be found in the biblical doctrine of man as a spirit. It
has been truly said by Cremer that we owe the conception of
human spirit, like that of spirit in general, to Sacred Scripture.
As in classic Greek it is the νοῦς, reason, so in biblical lan-
guage it is the πνεῦμα, spirit, which makes man to be man. In
illustrating the truth of this statement, we need not enter into
the mysteries of so-called biblical psychology. We need not
attempt to decide upon the true, one among the many distinc-

spirit, heart and soul. The customary use of ΠῆἾ οι· πνεῦμα,

spirit, emphasizes the religious nature and relations of man, as
referred to their origin in, and likeness to, the Divine Spirit.
The question whether the biblical psychology conceives of the
human spirit as belonging to human nature per se, has been often
raised and variously answered. It has been denied by HolstenS,
ι Weiss, and others, that the Pauline anthropology means to
ascribe a human spirit as belonging to the very constitution
of man. It has been maintained by Hofmann and others, that
man’s spirit is but the indwelling in man of the Spirit of God.
But the biblical view is rather, on the whole, that the spirit
which God gave to man at his creation becomes man’s own, the
centre of his personality as man.

As being, then, in fact and by his very constitution, spirit,
biblical revelation regards man as the subject of revelation and
inspiration. For the Divine Spirit can communicate itself to the
finite spirit in an ethical way. As spirit, man is fitted to live in
