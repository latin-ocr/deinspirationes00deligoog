for the sacred writers, but above all for their own new prophete,
the sufficient means of inspiration.’ '¹

From the time of Aurelius at least (A. D. 161-80), the ruore liberal
view of inspiration had its advocates (though m a minority), and
it indicated the progressive drift of thought, · but only in the
general reactiou of the church against Montanism did it come to
the surface, assert itself with energy, and finally after the middle
of the third century become controlling m the church. The aim
heneeforward was the rigid exclusion of all heathen elements
from the conception, especially the idea of ecstasy or suspension
of the human consciousness in the sacred writers. A human as
well as a divine side was reckoned to inspiration‚ the elevated sels-
consciousness and spontaneous activity of the person filled with
the Holy Ghost. This freer view was chiefly, though not exclu-
sively‚ represented iu the school of Alexandria.

The author of the Clementiae Homilies holds that the prophecy
of the true prophet is not ecstatic; be does not speak in a state
of madness, but knows what he says. Beholding it, he reveals it.
And what he reveals, he reveals clearly, unambiguousl y. He
does not utter doubts and uncertainties.

Miltiades, an Apologist, wrote, accordinoto Eusebius,2 a treatise
in the reign of Aurelius, to prove that it was not needful for the
prophet to speak in ecstasy.

Glement of Alexandria, in his Stromata, designates ecstasy as
a characteristic of false prophets and of the Evil Spirit. If he
compares mankind in general to an instrument upon which the
Logos plays, it is in a very different sense from Philo and Athen-
agoraS, who represent it as a merely passive organ of revelation.⁸

· Origen‚ if not the pioneer in this process of theological purga—
tion, certainly did much to establish upon grounds of reason,

and to fix indelibly in the consciousness of the church the μ

higher view which in his day was surely, if slowly and ‘irregularly,
working its way to recognition. He reckoned inspiration as be-
longing to the circle of church doctrines3 and in the fourth book
of his dogmatic work De P·r·incz]pii3 devotes a special chapter
