as well as Jews, God endowed distinguished men with prophetic
gifts. He here refers to philosophers. ι

Tertullian gives the impression that he also regarded every
writing useful for edification as inspired.¹

Origen († 254), thought that perhaps a place in the canon
should be assigned to the Shepherd of Hermas.

cyprian († 258) declared that he was favored with visione, and

speaks of writing certain epistles under the inspiration of God? ¹

These facts do indeed show that the ideas of these church-fathers
upon the subject of inspiration were in some respects indefinite,
but the reason is not far to seek. Some of them were acquainted
with the Old Testament only as existing in the version of the
Seventy, and therefore were inclined to view it with that rever·
enee which later orthodoxy accorded only to the Hebrew original.
It is to be remembered also that the canon of the N ew Testament
was not yet finally determined in the consciousness of the church.
More accurate investigations in this -department had yet to be
made. A more exact definition of inspiration itself had yet to be
supplied, and a more scientific theory of the same to be developed.

On the other hand, it is to be observed that the church never
committed itself to the sanction of any of the doctrinal vagaries
of individual fathers with reference to the sacred Scriptures and
their divine inspiration. Certain it is that ‘ always, everywhere
and by all ’ a higher deqree of inspiration was attributed to the
Old and N ew Testaments than to any other writings, one that
implied a clear and absolute infallibility of essential contents‚ and
a unique divine character. , ἡ

Olement of Alexandria, who perhaps dwells more at length
than any other ante-Nicene writer· upon this aspect of the subject,
while he concedes a ln‘nd of inspiration to the philosophers‚ and
thinks the Holy Ghost had imparted some truths to them, in
other ‚passages expressly concedes that they have fallen into error3
but he says of the Old and N ew Testaments: ‘⁶ Ι could cite many

other passages of which no point remains unfulfilled‚ for the ⁰

mouth of the Lord, the Holy Ghost‚ has spoken it.'’ ⁸
