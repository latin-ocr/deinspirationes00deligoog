crepancies of views and statements may be explained somewhat
as follows: ¹· ι

1. The hierarchica] church for centuries exerted herself to the
utmost to suppress all independence and individuality of thought,
all close investigation of the substcfnce of religione truth, and es-
pecially all study of the ScriptureS. By unsparing use of the
powers at her command—penalties civil and ecclesiastical, terrors
temporal and eternal——she in the main succeeded in her aim. As
the human mind, however, must have some field for its activities,
she graciously permitted a measure of freedom in dealing with
the forms of faith. TheologianS, if first supremely loyal to the
, church, and submissivc to her arbitrary restraints upon learning,
might take the material which she provided and work upon it.
They might define, systematize‚ demonstrate and defend ancient
ecclesiastical dogmas—in short, might justify to reason what had
first been received by saith. This produced the scholastic theol-
ogy which rose, culminated, declined and died a natura-l death
before the time of Luther.

But if the system itself had passed away, the spirit which it
nurtured, its methods and many of its most untoward efforts re-

subtle and acute, but superficial and cold questioning of the forms
of tuith—forms, we say, for it lacked· the vitality to go below
the surface to the deep reality of things

When now the Revival of Letters opened up the treasures of
classical antiquity, the sources of early Christian history, and the
Scriptures themselves in theIr original tongueS, then under the
impulse inspired by Humanism, this same critical spirit, furnished
with a new and worthy object, turned* its attention to the whole
church-system ‘ from turret to foundation, stone.' Not only was
the real character of the existing theology exposed to view, but
the sources of that theology in Scripture and ecclesiastical tra—
dition were subjected to rigid scrutiny. One idol of infallibility
was at once destroyed, and the sceptical Humanism was not slow
to ask whether a fallihle element might not exist within the other.
Not only did the Reformation movement itself in general tend to
boldness of thought and freedom of inquiry, but this critical
spirit, roused in reaction against the unquestioning credulity of
‘ mother-church,'—-eager, sels-confident, but not half instructed,
knew not to restrain itself within due bounds; but, in regard to
