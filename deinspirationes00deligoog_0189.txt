F. THE DOCTRINE OF INSPIRATION DURING
' THE REFORMATION ERA.

As Scholasticism 1611 1116 idea 61 inspirat-ion undeveloped, 66
1116 views of the leading 16161111616 611 1116 subject were in many
respects indefinite. The matter did 1161 661116 up 161 specific dis-
cussion, inasmuch as it did not form a subject of controversy with
Rome. All parties agreed that the Scriptures 61 1116 Old and
N ew Testa-ment are the word 61 God, aud authoritative in mat-
ters 61 161111 and practice. Subordinate differenceS, however,did
exist among the 16161111616 111 reference to the nature and extent
61 inspiration3 and these appear, not as formally stated in express
111661166, 11111 rather as incidentally developed 111 ‘various utterances
concerning the Holy Scriptures.

1. Erasmus.

It lay, as Kahnis admits,¹ in the very nature 61 Η1111161116111, with

all its emphasis 61 1116 1111111661 principle, 16 take a very 1166
view 61 1116 1111111611 61(16 61 Scripture. Thus Erasmus (†1536)
said: “ Only Christ is free from error. The authority 61 Scrip-
ture is not destroyed if the sacred writers do sometimes disagree
in word or meaning, provided only there remains unmoved the
sum total 61 11161 upon which rests our salvation.

The divine spirit ‚who controlled the minds 61 1116 apostles
suffered them 16 be ignorant 61 661116 things‚—sometimes to 11116-
take and err in judgment or affection, though never to the preju-
dice 61 the gospel.''

This utterance he subsequently recalled.
