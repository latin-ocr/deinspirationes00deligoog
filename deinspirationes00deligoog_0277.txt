INSPIRA TJON. 235

Or, to use terms of the Bible itself‚ they are fruits of the Divine
Spirit in the spirit of man. Ethical ideas and impulseS‚ when in-
spired, are still distinctively ethical ideas and impulseS. So far,
then, as we can have any psychology of inspiration, it must be a
sound human psychology. The inspired organs of revelation are
never more nor less, in their fundamental capacities‚ than we all
are. But there being inspired organs of revelation involves a
dynamical influence from the Divine Spirit in quickening, illu-
mining, elevating‚ and purifying, the normal spiritual powers·

It follows from what has just been said that revelation and
inspiration take place in man as a spiritual unity endowed with
a multiplicity of correlated powers. The unity of human nature
is a postulate of the biblical way of regardingOman ; it is also a
firmly established conclusion of modern physiologica] and meta-
physical psychology. In the realizing of divine revelation as a
subjective proceSS‚ the faculties of man must act in unity. In in-
spiration, these faculties must be affected as a living unity; and
the object of knowledge in revelation will contain elementS, so to
speak, which are mingled in it from all the activities of the soul.
Inspired prophetie vision cannot be considered as purely a matter
of the senses without the intellect, memory, and will; or of any
of the latter without the cooperation of the inner organs of sense.
Even ecstasy does not remove from its subject the necessity of
using the powers of reflection, in order to make clear to himself
the limits and meaning of the intuitions presented before the
mind in its ecstatic state. How close is this psychological unity,
and how subtle and manifold are all the relations which bind
together the various faculties of both body and soul, He knows
best who best knows man.

This unity, in accordance with whose conditions inspiration
takes place, does not, however, exclude a multiplicity and wide
range of powers. Of all these powers the centre and hearth is
the ethical personality, that spiritual nature by the possession of

, which man is like God, and communes with God. The inspira-

tion of conscience, and of the faculties employed in religious in-
tuition, is necessary, in·order that the contents of revelation
may become the contents of human consciousness. The inspi-
ration of these faculties is the controlling fact in the general im·
pression upon the faculties made by the inspired state.
