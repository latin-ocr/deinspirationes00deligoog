since the world began. Eighty γεω later, in 1880, the statis·
tics of eighty different Bible societies which are now in exist-
ence with their unnumbered agencies and auxiliarios, report
more than 165‚000‚000 Bibles, Testamenta, and portione of
Scriptum, with two hundred and six new translations, distributed
by Bible societies alone since 1804; to say nothing of the
unknown millions of Biblee and Testamenta which have been
issued and circulated by private publishers throughout the
world. For a book that has been exploded so many times, this
book yet shows signs of considerable life. ”

Ι hear of a man traveling around the country exploding this
Book and showing up “The Mistakes of Moses,'’ at about two
hundred dollars a night. It is easy work to abuse Moses at two
hundred dollars a night, especially as Moses is dead, and cannot
talk back. It would be worth something after hearing the infi-
del on “The Mistakes of Moses, ’⁹ to hear Moses on the mistakes
of the infidel. When Moses could talk back, he was rather a
difficult man to deal with. Pharaoh tried it, and sank like lead
beneath the waves. J annes and J ambres withstood Moses, and
it is said were buried in the Red Sea. Korsh, Dathan, and Abiram
tried it, and went down so deep that they have not yet got back.
But now Moses is dead, and it is easy to abuse him. It does
not take a very brave beast to kick a dead lion}

But, after all, this book seems to stand abuse, and thrive upon
· refutation. A few months ago some learned men, after working
for a number of years on the revision of the New Testament‚
finished their work. Having inserted a few modern words
instead of others which had become obsolete‚ made some slight
corrections of errors in translation, and rectified from ancient
manuscripts some little errors which had been made by copyists
in transcribing the book, at last the book was announced as
