the end, we find the second Adara, victorious over uin and
death end hell, enthroned aa King and Lord of ull, md reigning
in triumph and glory forever.

Now, when you get the plan of this Book, you find that it is
something more than a book of detached sentences, good maxims,
and comforting words. It is a Book which unfoldn the divine
purpose, and reveals not only the way of salvadeu, but it marks
the pathway of the people of God through thie wildernese, and
reveals the destiny of the world which he has mede md the
chnrch which he hae redeemed.

When we look nt these facts we seo that thiu is no man’s
book. When columbus discovered the river Orinoco, nome one
said he had found nn island. Hc replied: “No such river an
· that flows from nn island. 'rhat mighty torrent must dmin the
wetere of ο, continent.” So this Book comes, not from the
'empty hearts of impostore, liare, and deceivere3 it springs from
the eternnl depths of divine wisdom, love, and grace. Itis the
transcript of the Divino Mind, the unfolding of the divine pur·
pose, the revelation of the divine will. God help us to receive
it, to believe it, and be saved through Christ our Lord.
