both law and prophete, evangeliste, apostlee, pastore and teachers
spoke. ⁸ ‘ All Scripture, therefore, is given by inspiration of God,'
2. Tim. 3: 16.” Little more than thie can be gleaned from his
writinge.

11. Fridegisus.

FridegisUS, Abbot of Toure and pupil of Alcuin, appears ae
an advocate of verbal inspiration in the most rigid sense, main-
taining that the divine spirit inspired not only the meaning of
the Scriptures, their contente and methods of. expression, but
actually formed the very words in the mouths of the writers.
He appears aleo to extend infallibility even to translatore and
commentators.¹

111. Agobard.

Agobard, Archbishop of Lyons († 841) stoutly opposed these
extreme vieWS, and held them up to ridicule, by showing the
absurd consequences to which they led.2 He had some concep-
tione of, though he did not fully develop, the distinction of the
divine and human elements in the Scriptures.⁸ He conceded
aleo the existence of grammatical inaccuracies there, which, how-
ever, should be attributed not to the Holy Ghost, but to man,
who ie responsible for the form of the language. The eseence
of inspiration consiste in the general character of the contente,
not in the mere words themselves. ·

IV. Euthymius ZigabenuS.

Euthymius Zigabenue (about 1116) indirectly disclosee his viewev

respecting inspiration‚ when he accounts for the insertion of
given particulare in one gospel, and their omission in another, by
the fact of the greater or less completeness and exactness of
the recollectione of the writers. This again is explained by the
fact that they composed their narratives at some considerable
time after the occurrence of the events themselves.4
