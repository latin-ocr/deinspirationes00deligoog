merite, end yet each book is linked with ell the rest. Blot out
one, if you cen. 1 em inclined to think it would be difficult to
do this. This Book is built to stay together; it is inspired ΒΥ
οηὲΒΒοΡέιιῖΒοι-ώὶρ of this Book is wonderful. Here ere words
written ΒΥ kings, ΒΥ emperors, ΒΥ princes, ΒΥ poete, ΒΥ seges, ΒΥ

philosophers, ΒΥ fishermen, ΒΥ statesmen3 ΒΥ men learned in ,

the wisdom of Egypt, educated in the nchools of Babylon, trained
up at the feet of rebbis in Jerusalem. It was written ΒΥ men
in exile, in the desert, end in shepherd’s tents, in “gmen uss-
tures'' end beside “still waters.” Among its authors we und
the flshermsn, the tex-getherer, the herdsman, the getherer of
sycsmore fruit, we find poor men, rich men, stetesmen, presch-
ers, exiles, csptsins, legislatore, judges—men of every grsde
and class. 'rho authorship οι this Book &wonderfm beyond an
other books.

And what e book it is—filled with law, ethics, prophecy,
poetry, history, genealogy, medicine, sanitsry science‚ politicsl
economy. It contains all kinds of writing3 but what s jumble
it would be if sixty-six books were written in this way ΒΥ ordi·
nery men. Suppose, for instance, that we get nimy-six medical
books written ΒΥ thirty or forty different doetors of various
schools, believers in ellopsthy, homeopsthy, hydropsthy, end
su the other opsthies, bind them sll together, and then under-
tske to doctor e man according to that book! [Laughter.]

what men would be fool enough to risk the results of practic· “

ing such a system of medicine? Or, suppose you get thirty-five
editors st work writing trestises on politice, or thirty-five min-

isters writing books on theology, and then see if you can find “

any leather strong enough to hold the books together when they
have got through.

But again, it required fifteen hundred years to write this
Book, end the man who wrote the closing peges of it had no

- ⁸ communicetion with the man who commenced it. How did

these men, writing independently, produce such a book! Other
books get out of date when they are ten or twenty years old:
but this Book lives on through the ages, end keeps sbreast of
the mightiest thought and intellect of every ege.
