2 THE noornmss OF mstA'rIon:

in Christianity the wants are fully met, the ideas become glori-
ous 199111199.

Such an idea is that of Inspiration, in the broad sense of the
word. In the 1119101109] survey proposed, we must be content to
employ the term,‘as past ages have done, with some latitude of
meaning, „leaving 11109 distinctions and close definitions to the
province of doctrina} polemicS. We shall not undertake a study
of the subject in its more general relations to the canon, but shall
confine our investigations iri the main to two specific points: the
