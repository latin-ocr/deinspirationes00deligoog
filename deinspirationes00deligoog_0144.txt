Ske tice may rete about the mietekee of Moses, but it would
be ⁶ cult to nd a ter mletake than thoy make, when
they undertake to eit n judgment on a law which they have
never etudied‚ and the reasons for which they are not yet wine
enough to comprehend. The most advanced science of our
time· hae not yet reached the plane that Moses occu ied, and
we may still, with Israel’e Psalmnt, exclaim, “O n t ou mine
eyes, that Ι may behold wondroue things out of t y law. ”

1 recollect hearing Lord shaftesbury e in London‚ of at·
tending a Ooetermonger'e Exhibition of t e donkeye with which
they drag about their little barrows of provisions and merchan-
dise. He said there were fifty donkeys exhibited, looking ιι
eleek and beautiful ae if they had come out of the Queen’s eta-

nor thy maid-servant, nor thine ox, nor thine aas, nor any of thy
cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gatee.” Deut. v. 14.
The Lord well knew thet a donkey would do more work in a
week if he worked six dayS, than he would if he worked seven
days. He made provision that the donkey should have his

It ie a curione fact that after man hae overworked and become
wearied and exhamted, from the neglect of the appointed times
