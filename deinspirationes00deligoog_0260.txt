complete and symmetrical development than would otherwise
have been possible.

If the outcome of present controversies should prove different,
it would indee'd be ‘ a new thing under the sun.’

It is matter of fact that to-day, as the result of the very criti-
cism which is viewed in so many quarters with alarm, and pend-

general fabric of the Scriptures, ‘apart from the question of
its inspiration, stands on a firmer footing than it did a century
ag0.' , This, by the unwilling confession of rationalism itself.

Surely then, simple-hearted saith in the divine oracles may well
rest quietly, thank God for that ‘whereto it has already attained,'

and take courage for the future.
