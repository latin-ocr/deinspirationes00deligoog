Puritans in England. He treats inspiration froin the standpoint
of prophecy, and makes it, on the divine side, to be ‘an act of
the Holy Ghost in conimunicating his mind to the propheti-2³ ¹
From this point of view three things enter into it:

a. The inspirationi of the minds of holy. men with the knowl-
. edge and apprehension of the things continiunicated to them.

b. The suggestion of words to express what their minds con-
ceived.

c. The guidance of their hands iu setting down the words sug—
gested.

If either of these requisites were wanting, the Scriptures could
not be absolutely and every way divine and in‘t'allible.2

As to the exstent of inspiration, he observes: ‘⁶ It is not enough
to satisfy us that the doctrines mentioned are preserved entire:
every tittle and iota of the word of God must come under our
consideration as being as such from G0d.''

Again: “The Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments were
immediately and entirely given out by God himself, his mind
being in them represented to us without the least interveniency
of such mediums and ways as were capable of giving change oi·
alteration of the least letter or syllable.”

Careful⁸study shows that he intended to reject, and perhaps
with equal emphasis, two opposite eri-ors: one, that the matter
only of the Holy Scripture was divinely communicated, while
the verbal expression was left to the natural faculties3 and the
other, that the minds of the sacred peninen were under su-ch co-
'ercive influence from above that they became mere machines.
All used their own intellects and powers, and the Holy spirit
suggested such words as were familiar to each, but yet in such
way that the words fixed upon were from him as directly and cer·
tainly as if they had been spoken to them by an audible voice.’·'⁸
