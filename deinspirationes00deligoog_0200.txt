48 THE Doc‘mmn OF INSPIRATION:

concerns either that which was previously hidden or already dis-
closed, and is effected only through the Holy Ghost.¹

Another distinction made by theologiam of more liberal views
will be noticed below. ⁶

2. T he Ezetent of Impimtion. ( Verbal [aspi—ration.)

a. Citations already made show clearly the views of the High
Lutheran theologians of the seventeenth century in the matter.
Everything pertaining to Scripture, whether substance or form, was
alike the direct work of the Holy Ghost. Prophecy, dogma,
poeti-y,l1istory,—all, without exception, were included.

Thus Quenstedt: ‘⁶ The original Scripture is of infallible
truth, and free from every error3 or what is the sanie thing, in
canonica] Scripture there is no falsehood, no untruth, not even
the least error either in facts 01· in words3 but all things and
everything which is related there, is most true, whether those
things are doctrinal, moral, historical, chronological or topograph-
ical, and no ignorauce, thoughtlessness or forgetfulness, no error
of memory can be, or ought to be, imputed to the amanuenses of
the Holy Ghost i'n their recordS.” ’

Words as well as things were included. Calovius (†1686) de-
clared that, ⁶ Grod inspired those things which apostles and proph-
ets wrote, and not only as to the sense and meaning, but as to the
'words which were suggested and dictated to them, just as they
are contained in Scripture.’

Hollaz: ‘⁶ All words and every word which is contained in the ·

sacred text was inspired by the Holy spirit in prophete and apos-
tleS, and was d'ictated to a pen.”

Quenstedt: ‘The words themselves, and all and every ex—
pression has the Holy Ghost individually suggested, inspired, and
dictated to the sacred writers.'’

b. The Lutheran theologians maintained that the Hebrew vowel
points were original, rather than the work of the later MassoleteS,
and thus pa-rtook of the inspiration of the text.

Gerhard said that to deny that the vowels and points of the
Old Testament proceeded from inspiration would compel one to
deny the doctrine of verba] inspiration wholly.
