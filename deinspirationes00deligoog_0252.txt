‘ with Christ's own mission, with the gift of tongues and miracu-
lons powers, with the special promises of the Comforter and

gnidance by him into all truth, and with the assurance of Christ's “

own presence—were in a worse position, or more liable to error
than the prophets.' ¹

The essentia] thing is infallibility in things pertaining to God
and religione truth. Yet with all the pains and ingenuity which
have been bestowed upon the subject, no charge of error, even in
matters of human knowledge, has ever yet been substantiated
against any of the writers of the Scriptures? If the case had
been otherwise, there wonld still be no cause for disquietude, so
long as the supernatural element was such, both in character and
extent, as to secure infallible truth in things divine.

We may note here the definition of inspiration given by the
learned A. S. F arrar, in his ‘ Oritical History of F ree Thonght ε ’ ⁸

“ Inspiration is, if analyzed psychologically, probably a form of
the ‘ reason ; ' but, if viewed theologically, it is an elevated state
of this faculty, brought about by the miracul‘ous and direct opera-
tion of God’s Spirit: so that in this view it differs in kind, and
not merely in depth from human genius.'' ⁴ ·

A series οἱ writers holding more radical opinions now demand
our notice.

20. Dwvidson.

Dr. S. Davidson asserts that inspiration did not lift man above
error. It did not confer upon th'e sacred writers the attribute of
infallibility. They were still peccable men, but, possessing the
Spirit of Grod in remarkable degree, were gifted with peculiar
insight into his mind.

Their own subjectivity mingled with and formed part of their
inspiration. We take them as guides to saith and practice gener-
ally, without adopting all that they propounded, or believing that
they could foretell future events,¹⁵
