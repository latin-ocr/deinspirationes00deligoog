4 THE nocuum-3 oF msmssA'noN:

It thus appears that the development of the doctrine of inspi-
ration was substantially the same in the case of the Persian canon
as in that of the Hindu.

It has been said of the three great religions of China, Con-
fucianism‚ Buddhism and Taoism, that in their true conception
they are not religions at all, as having no persona] God3 but
that they are rather systems of philosophy, one moral, another
metaphysical, and a third materialistic. If this be s0, none

That God should make known his will from above, did not seem
