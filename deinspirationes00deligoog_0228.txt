76 THE noo'rnnm or mstA'rloN:

the Christian capon, partly from the appeals made to them by
N ew Testament writers, and partly from the historical connec-
tion between Christianlworship and the J ewish synagogae.¹

Rationalistic as these views of Schleiermacher clearly were, it is
nevertheless true that the general influenoe, both of the man him-
self and of his doctrinal system, was opposed to rationalism, and
in favor of positive faith in a positive revelation.

111. Supernaturalism.

This was a. product of the transition period, and, while main-
taining old forms of expression, departed essentially from the
old orthodox Lutheran faith. The older divines had based their
theory of inspiration upon the inner necessity of the thing3 the
supernaturalists founded theirs on the promise of Christ to bestow
his Spirit on the apostles. The historica] certainty of inspiration,
then, rested upon the authority and trustworthiness of J esus as an
immediate divine teacher.' ⁶ Supernaturalism ’ found the super-
natural element in revelation, not in the form but in the contente
of the sacred writings. Upon revelation it laid chief stress, and
viewed the apostles as the chief witnesses thereto.³ To this school
the trustworthiness of the Scriptures was of supreme importance,
rather than their divine origin and authority. It was believed that
in the written records, the assistance of the Spirit was enJ’oyed
to such a degree as to preserve the authors from error in ‘matters
of faith. In regard to‘ nou-essentiale they were left to the exercise
of their own faculties‚ and of course were fallible.

1. Twesten.

This divine was one of the supernaturalists attaching himself to
the school of Schleiermacher. Like N itzsch, he professed not to
deviate essentially from the definitions of the older theologians,
but rather to accept them. N one the less does he confess a mul-
titude of weaknesses in the old theory, aud therefore make the
more desperate effort to save his orthodoxy, and at the same time
preserve his allegiance to his master. He actually succeeded, like
other divines of this class, iu wavering between the two.⁴
