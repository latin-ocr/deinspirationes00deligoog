36 ‘rme Doc'rRmE OF INSPIRATION ἶ

accompanied with a state of panic terror, and that all·the senses
rest from their functions.¹ He quotes Daniel 2128 ff. in proof of
his assertion.
· None the less was it maintained that the seer could exercise his
office only in a cahn and joyous frame of mind, because ⁶ proph-
ecy could not dwell amid confusion of the senses or pain, but only
in the midst of joy.¹

Rudelbach observes that both of these definitions must be taken
as imperfect attempts to explain that which the Scripture em-
braces under the common name of propl1eoy.²

2. Deqreea

Various degrees of inspiration in prophecy were admitted.
Maimonides attempted to determine them at ‘eleven or eight,’
of which the first two could only by a figure of speech be reck-
oned to the head of prophecy. Albo reduced these to four, and
Abarbanel to three, corresponding to the three-sold division of
the J ewish Scriptures into the Law, Prophets and Hagiographa.3
The Law embodied the highest stage of prophecy, and was the
fountain-head of revelation, · the Prophets ranked next, while the
Hagiographa, being given not by*- the‘ Spirit of prophecy’, but
only by that of l‘mlinessss could not be considered as in any real
sense inspired at all. ⁸

Maimonides (†1104), the only one of the later J ewlsh doctors
whose opinion is of especial historical importance, far from' conced-
ing that the Bible was the pure product of the divine activity upon
the human spirit, saw in it a book differing from other bookS, even
on its religious side, not in kind, but only in degree. The me-
' diaeval Spanish rabbi here shapcd the thinking of the great Jewish
pantheist of the seventeenth century Spinoza, through him in-
fluenced the later German rationalism‚ and thus powerfully,
though mediately, the English thought of our own age

XII. General Conclusions.

If now we ask what is the significance of the Middle AgeS, as
a whole, for the history of our doctrine, it is hard to make answe-r.
