biblical idea of inspirationis the theocratic ‘in-spiriting' of the

men, not of the writinqs, for they were not ‘ in-spirited ' to write. · Ι

6. Henhe.

Henke († 1809) gave full and free expression to the rational-
istic view, when he said that the sacred writers were moved to
literary composition, and actually entered upon the work, from ο
the desire of being serviceable to otherS, and from the opportunity
thus presented3 that they made choice of material according to ⁴
the peculiar necessities of time and place, drew the facts them-

one who was moved by the divine Spirit, as an organ pipe through
which the wind blows, —an empty machine from which all
thoughts of its own are far removed. Oabbalistic ideas first gave
birth to the concept-ion of a sacred writing as a connected whole.
These ideas were then propagated by the Alexandrian philosophy, ⁹
and entered into Christianity. In the confiict with hereticS, an
appeal was made to an iwspired Word, and with the increase of
ignorance, the lordship of in-apiration was founded, upon which
finally Scholasticism set it seal. The word of God is nothing
