6 THE Docrmnn or mstA'rIoN:

whether and how far its development in Mohammedanism was
influenced by crude and exaggerated views prevalent in the cor-
rupt Christianity and Judaism of the time and region.

It has been said, somewhat rashly perhapS, that ‘⁶ we search
the literature of Greece and Rome in vain for the idea of revela-
tion.” ‘If the affirmation be restricted to book-revelation, it may,
perhaps, be approximately true, though the Sibylline books with
their sacred character and supposed divine origin should count

this vulgar idea, but maintained, with the Stoics and almost the
whole of antiquity, that the sense for higher revelation arises in
a condition of unconsciousness, in sleep, and most of all in ecstasy.

inspiration3 but when he receives the inspired word, either his
