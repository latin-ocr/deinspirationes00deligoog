mental powers of inspired rnen. He may have entertained
mutually conflicting ideas on the whole subject.

When under the influence of inspiration, a person was in a
state of ecstasy3 and this to Philo was the ‘ goal of ambition,’
and, as he testifies, in some sense a matter of persona] experience
with him. He claims inspiration not only for himself, but for
every pious man3 and yet he oy no means attempts to place his
own productions, or those of his fellows‚ on a level with Holy
Scriptnre. His idea of ecstasy implies such a perfect self·
surrender to the fellowship and influence of Deity, as to result
in a complete suppression of the human consciousness and will
before those which are divine. “ The prophet,” he says, “is the
interpreter of the Deity, and God uses him as an instrument to
make known what he will. A prophet says nothing of his own,
, but merely what another inspires within him.”

Somewhat inconsistently with his magical view of inspiration,
Philo admits a difference of deqree in the same. In the hiqheat
(ἑρμηνεία) the utterances are immediately from God3 the human
clement wholly recedeS, the divine only comes to view, and that
pure and unmixed. There is a union, or rather absorption of the
person inspired in the God who moves and speaks within him.
In the secund or intermediam stage, there is a mingling of the
purely divine with the human, both of which appear 3 the prophet
questions and God replies (as in the Zend-Avesta); thus he is
able to predict the future with infallible certainty. In the
lowest stage, the inspiration proceeds from the divine, which has
become the personal possession of the prophet. The latter speaks
insshis own name from his own consciousness, though the substance
of the message is from God. Ι

Oareful scrutiny shows that at the bottom of Philo’s idea of .
prophetic ecstasy there is no higher element than is drawn from
heathen divination and mystery-worship. His syncretistic system
allowed him to transfer the heathen conceptions of μαντική, or
‘ divine possessions,’ to the prophets of the Old Testament.
But more than this, the whole Philonic (and thus far, Hellenistic)
theory is of heathen origin.

Conceding, as all critics dc, the immense influence which
Philo exerted ultimately upon this, as well as upon the whole
circle of Christian doctrine, it is hot enough to admit, with Hagen-
bach, that the external form of the theory of inspiration was
