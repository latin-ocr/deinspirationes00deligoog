Young Men’e Christian Amoeiations, 111-03011013, (10300113, or any·
thing 0130 of the kind—you ean “go Weet.” There 13 little dif-
fieulty in getting beyond the reaoh of the Bible. Your sealp
might not be very ease, but you oan easily get away from the
reeoh of the Bible. But the infldel, while finding fault with
the Bible, takes good care to stay where the Bible 13. Why is

There was once a vessel wreoked on one of the South Sea
islanda. There was 011 board a sailor who had been there before,
and wh'o knew that the people were eannibaIS. And when the
ship was wreoked, and they were east away 011 this shore, they
knew there wau no hope for them, for they saw no way to escape·
The 331101, however, elimbed up on a hill-top to reconnoitre
a little. Prosently his ehipmates saw him ewinging his arms in
great exeitement, and inquired what was the matter. He had
seen just over the hill, the etcople qs a maenaa-homo! [Applause]
That was what took all the sear of trouble out of his 30111. He
knew that ohureh-spire made 1113 neck ease 011 that oannibal
island.

NoW, infidels know that faet just as well 33 he did. Yearu
ag0‚ a young infidel was traveling in the West with his uncle,
a banker, and they were not a little anxious for their safety
when they were forced to stop for a night in a rough way-side
eabin. There were two 1001113 111 the house3 and when they
retired for the night they agreed that the young man should sit
with 1113 11131013, and wateh until midnight, and then awaken
1113 uncle, who should wateh until morning. Presently they
peeped through the eraok‚ and saw their host, a rough-looking
old man in 1113 bear-skin suit, reaeh up and take down a book——
a Bible; and after reading it awhile, he knelt and began to pray3
and then the young infidel began to pull .off 1113 ooat and get
ready for bed. The old man said, “1 thought you were going
to sit up and watoh.” But the young man knew there was 110
need of sitting up, pistol in hand, to wateh all night long 111 a
oabin that was hallowed by the word of flod, and consecrated
by the voiee of prayer. Would a paok of carde, a rum-botae,
or a eopy of the “Age of Reaeon” have thus quieted thie young
man’a seara!
