the Gnostics who wished to distinguish between J esus and Christ)
and guarding by anticipation against their deceit, says. ‘ But the
birth of OnmsT was on this wise. ⁹ ”¹

Yet the same father acknowledges imperfections² 1n the style
of Paul, and attributes them to the impetuosity and fire of the
apostle-—in short, to his temperament.

3. Tertullian seems clear and explicit in his declarations: “ Our
sacred Scriptures,’' he sayS‚ “ are the very words and letters of
God.'' As‘ a Montanist he could consistently hold no other view
than that of absolute dictation3 yet expressions occur which it is
hard logically to reconcile with this belief. His general position,
however, cannot be considered doubtful.

4. Clement of Alexandria says: ‘⁶ Truly holy are those letters
that sanctify and deify, and the writings that consist of those holy
'letters and syllables, this same apostle (Paul) calls inspired of
God.'’⁸ -

5. Origen appears to accept verbal inspiration without qualifica-
tion, holding that every iota of the Scriptures has a special value ;4
yet one finds¹ scattered in his „writings passages which seem in-
consistent with this view, as e. g. when he calls attention to sole-
cisms in the lang-uage of the sacred writers,

6. Eusebius⁵ may be credited with the same opinion, since he
considers ‘ each one who proposes to alter the words of the Bible
as esteeming himself wiser than the Holy Ghost)

From these and similar testimonies the inference may be drawn
that among the ante-Nicene fathers verbal inspiration was in
some sense a general article of faith, though some wavered, and
it is hard to say just how much weight is to be given to indi·
vidual utteranceS.

N itzsch⁰ endeavors to explain away the force of such testi-
monies as we have quoted above, and maintains that, apart from
the ecstatics (Athenagoras, the Montanists, etc.,) no church teacher
positively and consistently taught the theory of verbal inspiration.
