IIaying denied to the sacred writers miraculous powers, verba]
dictation or any distinct commission to their work from G0d‚¹ he
proceeds to affirm the generic resemblance of biblical inspiration
to that of genius. Genius consists in the possession of a remark-
able power of intuition with reference to some particular object,
a power which arises from the inward nature ·of a man being
