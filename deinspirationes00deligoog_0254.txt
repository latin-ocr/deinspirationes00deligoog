actually proceeded to exercise upon it the critical office. Infalli-
bility certainly finds no province here.

The (livine element in the Scriptures is left indefinite as to the
scope of its application. Apparently no more is conceded than
that it concertis such a ‘knowledge of God and of his will as is
necessary *to salvation.' The author would probably make it
inclusive simply of ‘ God's command8‚ threatenings and promises

- addressed to our saith, and above all, of the gospel offer of Christ

to us.' The ground of fait-h in the divine origin and character of
the truths contained within the Scripturas is not to be found in
any externa] testimonies to an objective revelation, but simply
and solely in the subjective convictions of persona] experience
wrought within the heart by the power of the Holy Ghost. This
being accepted, it is hard to see what functions yet remain to
supernatura] inspiration.

Better‚ however, than any attempted analysis of the views of
Prof. Smith, may be a few citations from his latest published
works. Thus he says:

“ The persuasion that in the Bible Grod himself speaks words of
love and life to the soul, is the essence of the Christian’s conviction
as to the truth and authority of the Scriptures.¹

“ Of this I am sure at the outset, that the Bible does speak to
the heart of man in words that (3311 come only from God--that no
historical research can deprive me of this conviction, or make less
precious the divine utterances that speak straight to the heart.

‚ “For the language of those words is so clear that no re-ad-
justment of their historica] setting (3311 conceivably change the
substance of them.

“The supreme truths which speak to every believing beart, the
way of salvation, which is the same in all ageS, the clear voice of
God's love, so tender and persona] and simple that a child can
understand it—these are things which must abide with us, and ι
prove themselves mighty from age to age, apart from all scientific
study.²

“The inspired writers were so led by the Spirit that they
perfectly understood and perfectly recorded every word which
Grod spoke to their hearts.⁸
