gentleman he is in all hia deportment. The fact ia, he is a
liar, a fraud, and a ecamp. He has come under false colors,
and palmed himself off on the community under falae pre-
tense-3 and the more good things you say about him the leae
I think of him ς because, if he is euch a well—educated gentleman,
he known better than to be going around aa a fraud, and deceiv-
ing the people. So we must accept Jeaus of Nazareth and hie

been used to print the word of God3 and the very house where
he lived hae been packed with Biblee from gari-et to cellar, aa a
depot for th'e Bible Society. Thomas Paine demoliahed the
Bible, and finished it off, finally3 but after he had crawled
