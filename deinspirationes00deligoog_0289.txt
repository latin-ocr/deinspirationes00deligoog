disturbed, the clear inspiration of God from the passionate trans-
port.” The peculiar phenomena of ecstasy, instead of serving
‘as they once did to authenticate by their peculiarity the inspired
condition of the subject of ecstasy, now serve rather to embar-
rass the proof. For the condition of ecstasy is not confined to
the sphere of religious excitement; and, as an excitement, it is
not confined to any religion alone. Physiologically considered,
it consists in the suspension of the external organs of sense as
susceptible to externa] excitement‚ and in the greatly increased,
and even the diseased, activity of the inner organs of imagina-
tion and sense. Psychically considered, it is an intense and con-
centrated activity of the mind upon some one object of contem-

stances, and position and office 1n the Kingdom of Redemption‚
of its subject. That the inspiration of different persons will
differ in the degree and mode of its manifestation is a corollary
from the general truth which makes it a truly personal affair.
There are various gradeS, degreeS, typeS‚ and modes of the one
spiritual gift. But the Giver is one; and these differences con

them all.

7. Inspiration also varies in the degree and proportionate
activity of the faculties involved. We are not, indeed, to speak
of this variation as though it could be a basis for classifying the
kinds of inspiration; 35, for instance, an inspiration of memory, ·
an inspiration of intellect, a verbal inspiration, etc. But it might
well happen that certain cases of inspiration will cause us to lay
emphasis upon the exalted and quickened condition of some of
· the faculties; and certain other cases upon the same condition
in other of the facultieS. In the case of the Fourth Gospel‚ we
have especial emphasis laid upon the inspired insight which was
born of long reflection upon matters of personal experience, so
dear and impressive as were the words and deeds of Christ to
the author of this Gospel. Manifestly not by any sudden seiz·
