ful fact that yon ean hardly go into e prayer-meeting but yon ·

are likely to hear a quotation from scripture thet is not in the
Bible and never was. Yon may hear, “In the midst of life we
are in death,” from the Prsyer-book3 “He tempere the wind to
the shorn lemb,” from en old romanoe3 “God unehangeably
ordains whetsoever eomes to psss‚” from the Oeteehism3 accom-
panied by passages misquoted, misundemtood, end misapplied‚
which show thet the people do not read their Bibles end do not
understand them3 and the worst thing about it is, one-heli the
people who go to meeting do not seem to know the differenoe.
