' AN ouTLINE ms'roRmAL STUDY. 103

“ The Bible is a hook of experimental religion, in which the
converse of God with his people is depicted in all its stages, up
to· the full and abiding manifestation of saving love in the person
of J esus Christ. God has no message of love to the believing
souI, which the Bible does not set forth.'' ¹

These utterances‚ in their detached form, have a certain¹ sound

and savor of orthodoxy3 but it remains true, nevertheless‚ that the .

views of Prof. Smith‚ as actually applied to the canon, are subver-
sive of all belief in inspiration‚ at least in the sense commonly
understood and accepted by the orthodox consciousness of the
chnrch.

The next group of writers is, if possible, still more strongly
pronounced in its expression of negative views '

23. Mordl.

Morell, a disciple of Schleiermacher, and essentially at one with
the advanced Broad-church school in views upon our subject,
distinguishes revelation and inspiratiom but regards them as two
different sides of one divine act. The former is an exercise of
power by which God presents the realities of the spiritual world
immediately to the human mind3 the latter is that especial influ-
ence wrought in the mind of the subject, by which he is enabled to
'grasp those realities in perfect fulness and integrity. God made a
· revelation of himself to the world in 'J esus Christ, but it was the
inspiratiou of the apostles which enabled them clearly to discern
it.² The result of the two is to produce in the human mind a state
of intuition, whose phenomena are so extraordinary, that we at
once separate them from any of the ordinary principles of human
development. Yet this agency is applied in perfect consistency
with the laws and natural operations of our spiritual nature.

Inspiration does not imply anything generically new in the
actual processes of. the human mind3 it does not involve any form
of intelligence essentially different from what we already possess3
it indicates rather the elevation of the religious consciousnesS‚ and
with it, of course, the power of spiritual vision to a degree of
intensity peculiar to the individua] thus highly favored by Grod.⁸
