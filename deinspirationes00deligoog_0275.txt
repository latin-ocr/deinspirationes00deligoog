previously seen that God does not turn back, or break up, nature
in order to work a miracle in the midst of her natural activities.-
He will not overthrow the fabric of human nature when He
supet-naturally produces effects in the midst thereof.

But if the theological point of view enables us to affirm the
probability, the psychological enables us to assert the necessity,
that,the laws of human consciousness shall be considered as fur·
nishing the limits and conditions of inspiration. It is not the
work of inspiration to depreSS, but rather to elevate, the faculties
of man: not to kill but to make alive does the⁸ Spirit of God
enter the spirit of man. It is, therefore, one of the characteristic
differences between biblical revelation and the theophanies of
heathenism, that the former results in placing within the thought
of the race certain contents of truth, which are more and more
clearly defined in the moral and religious consciousness of men.
And it is characteristic of biblical inspiration that it does not
obscure and confuse, or abolish, human sels-consciousneSS, as
does the inspiration of the heathen mantic.

It is true of all the objective elements which together make
up revelation, objectively considered, that they can become ele-
ments of revelation only so fast and so far as they furnish con-
tent to the human consciousness. We cannot, then, with strict
accuracy follow the language of Rothe (in his Zur Dogmatik),
and speak as though revelation could be independent of its being
recognized as revelation. There is no single act of revelation
consummated which is not consummated within some thinking
spirit. And this consummation of revelation within a thinking
spirit involves a subjective process which is inspiration, or the
divine act in quickening, illumining, elevating and purifying,
the powers of that spirit. But, this is only to say, in another
form, that the laws of human consciousness furnish the necessary
conditions for revelation and inspiration. The miracle is a reve-
lation of God only as it is apprehended and interpreted by an
ethical and religious consciousness thus inspired. Sacred history
is effective as revelation only when its moral and religious con·
tent is discerned by some mind with clear and penetrating in-
sight. The word of God, however it may present itself for rec-
ognition, must be translated into intuitions and thought3‚ or be
recognized as the cause of feeling and impulse, within the human
