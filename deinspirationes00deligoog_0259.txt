general belief among heathen and Christians, Jews and Gentiles,
in every age. It readily responds to the triple test of Catholicity,
viz., acceptance “ semper, ubique, ab omnibus.''

II. Theories as to the nature and extent of biblical inspiration ‘
should be always, and in great measure have actually been, broadly
distinguished from the fact itself. Unanimity with reference to
the 'latter is the more abundantly proved by the comparative
absence of dogmatic speculations upon the former, during the
first fifteen centuries of the history of the church.

ΙΙΙ. Abandoning the common, but really useless attempt at a
rigid classification of the various theories of inspiration, we may
yet say with confidence that no single one has ever commanded
sufficiently general assent to entitle it to rank (as party zealots
would have it) as ‘ the immemorial doctrine of the church of God)

’ IV. History furnishes conclusive evidence that no doctrine of
inspiration can hope for general acceptance in the church, which
fails to accord full recognition to the co-existence, co-activity and
harmonious relation of the two factors—-divine and human—in
the same.

All efforts wholly to displace, or unduly to exalt the one or the
other, will be met by a more or less prompt, and certainly a strong
reaction against the sole supremacy of this, and a like re-assertion
of the factor which is denied or undervalued. The doctrine in
its historical development has given evidence of a kind of sels-

corrective power, which, in the long run at least, is sure to make
its presence and efficient operation manifest.

V. If the truth of the foregoing statement be conceded, it is
plain that the doctrine of inspiration, properly so called, can have
nothing to fear from the attacks of modern biblical criticism, be
they those of avowed rationalism, of pseudo-evangelicalism (whose
loud professione of allegiance to confessional standards scarcely
suffice to conceal its really neqato'sve spirit and intent), or of reac-
tionary orthodoxy and bigotry.

The trend of opinion at the present day is, as seen above, toward
a fuller recognition of the human clement in the Scriptures3 and
bold assertions are made of errors manifold in fact, and even in
doctrine (which in a historic revelation like the Bible arises out of
fact), but it is to be rememered on the other hand:
