before said: “ Objective revelation does not attain its own final
purpose, unless it realize itself in a subjective and spiritual
process. There can be no revelation as a process of history
without an inspired community to receive, foster, test, and
appreciate it.” It is to this subjective and spiritual process
which goes on in the inspired community that we now direct
our attention.

The only tenable conception of inspiration is that which
makes it a personal transaction, as to the nature and result of
which we have clear light only by ‘viewing the two personalities
involved in the transaction. These personalities are, of course,
always two spiritS, the Infinite and Eternal Divine Spirit, and
the spirit of man made in the image of God and made for re-
ceiving the spiritual sels-communications of God. We must,
then, approach the idea of inspiration by considering the idea
of the agent of all inspiration, which is that of a personal,
spiritual, and divine principle known as the Holy Spirit. And
that idea of this Holy Spirit which gives us the true idea of
inspiration is the biblical rather than any theological or specu-
lative idea. To a brief presentation of the biblical idea the fol-
lowing three remarks are fitly preliminary:

1. There must 'be some special reason, either ,doctrinal or
historical, or both, why the work of inspiration is in the Bible
referred to the ῃηἾ or πνεῦμα, Spirit of God, rather than simply

to God, or the LogOS, or νοῦς, Reason of God. The two concep·
tions of Logos and Spirit, as media of divine communicationS,
personifications of divine rational and spiritual powerS‚ and,
finally, personal divine energies, develop together through the
entire course of biblical revelation. At times they seem to con-
verge and even unite in the same conception; aS, for example,
when we are told in Psalm, xxxiii, 6, that the heavens were
made by the word of the Lord and by the spirit of his mouth.
The wonderful effect which the biblical conception has wrought
upon the meaning of the Greek word πνεῦμα, spirit, its frequent
use in the biblical bookS, and the comparative neglect of that

word νοῦς, reason, which the classic Greek so fitly glorified, are ·

among the most remarkable phenomena in biblical linguistiCS.
The classic Greek would scarcely have known what to make of
the phrase τό πνεῦμα τοῦ Θεοῦ, tlte spirit of God,· while the
