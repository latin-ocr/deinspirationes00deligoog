else than light—insight3 among the Hebrews spirit and word
were one. The Spirit which Christ promised to his followers
was only his doctrine, his memory, his illuminated likeness.¹

1. Stapfer.

This divine, theologica} professor at Berne († 17 7 5) says z ‘⁶ We
must distinguish between those parts of the sacred Scriptures
which were written by the immediate impia-atim of the Holy
Ghost, and those which have been consigned to writing by his
directim only. To the former class belong the peculiar discov-
eries of ’ revelation respecting the way of salvation, predictions, etc.
To the latter class belong truths already known from natural re-
ligion.”

He adds, however: ‘⁶ Nor was any error permitted to creep in
with regard even to the minutest fact or circumstance. All alike
comes to us through inspiration, and is of equal precision, whether
it be by revelation, observation, or reasoning3 if we follow the
· latter, there can be no error in our conclusionS, except by not
properly applying the laws of interpretation.” ’

ῙῙῙ. . Swedenborg.

Swedenborg's († 17 7 2) doctrine of inspirationis unique and ob—
scure. An adequate conception of it is to be gained only from
the study of his writings, or at least from a detailed exposition of
his views by one of his initiated disciples. The reader is re-
ferred, among other sources of information, to an article by Rey.
Ohauncey Giles, in the N ortk American Review, October, 187 8
pp. 314—319. Some of the following statements are taken from
that paper.

With Swedenborg, the Scriptures and the word of Grod -are
identical, and are divine truth itself. ‘⁶ If the Word were not
true,” he says, ‘⁶ we could know nothing of God, of heaven or of
hell, of life after death, and still less of the Lord.” He held
that man has no innate knowledge, but must leam everything
he knows in every sphere. Revelation, therefore, is absolutely
indispensable to teach him of beings and worlds that may exist

beyond the realm of the senseS. ·
