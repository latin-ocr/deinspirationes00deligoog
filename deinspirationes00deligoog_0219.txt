AN ouTLINE HISTORIOAL s‘rUDY. 67

It is to be noted that Swedenborg applies the term ‘word of
God,’ not to our canonical books, b'ut to anot-her Scripture ants->2
dating and superior to ours. He calls it the ‘ Scripture of an-
gels.’ He advances also to another identification. As the Scrip-
ture is the ‘word of G0d‚’ so the ‘word of God’ is the Lord
himself. As God descended in order to become veritable man in
the Son, so 31θοὶ does the Word—the divine proceeding from the
Lord—ssthat is, the Lord himself, descend through three stages to
man. Thesestages are the celestial, the spiritual, and the natural.

In regard to those of the commonly received Scriptures which
he admitted as canonical, he seems to have taught deqrees of in· ’
spiration, for he distinguished the immediate utterances of God
‘himself from those made by angels in his behalf. ‘⁴ The books
spoken by the Lord, by the mouths of the prophetS, were the
five books of Moses, J oshua, J udges, First and Second Samuel, “
First'and Second Kings, the PsaImS‚ and all the Prophets from
Isaiah to Malachi, the four Gospels and the Revelation.’' ‘⁴ The
other books of the so-called canon are good and useful, and pos-

corded to the whole Bible‚ but they do not contain a connected
spiritual meaning, and they are not therefore the word of the

Lord, and they do not claim to be.” ¹
⁵ All the sacred books alike stand in imperative need of a new
revelation—that of Swedenborg—to render them intelligible.

Inspiration ⁸itself is the divine choice and use of natural forms
for the expression of spiritual and eternal truth. Under the su-
pernatural influence, speech and record alike become the faithful
reflection of the Higher and Supreme Will. ·

With reference to the eoetent of inspiration, Swedenborg would
seem to have accepted the verbal theory. At all eventS, he held
single words of Scripture to be of so great importance as to fear,
from the loss of the smallest of them, great peril to the whole con-'
nection of a passage. He appeals to the counting of the letters
by the Massoretes as an arrangement of divine Providence for
the preservation of the Scriptures from injury.² ’

The same verbal theory is suggested by his view that absolutely

everything in Scripture is significant. Even the numbers and
