JNSPJRA TJON. 239

as may be readily brought under the dictum de omni et nullo, In ,
morals and religion, as in all other cases of interest to conduct,
we do not get the terms of our syllogisms thus clearly stated for
uS. We rather find them as mingled with many guesses and
opinions; we are glad enough, forsooth l to get suggestions
which will lead us near to one of the higher forms of probability.
And to affirm that God cannot so move upon the' mind of man
as to lead him, along the normal lines of his own intellectual
activity, from a principle to its true application, from a general
law to a particular case made known as coming under the law,
is to affirm that God cannot do for man what men daily do for
one another. But the purely deductive process does not exhaust
the capacity of the human intellect. For man’s reasoning is
never purely deductive. Induction blends with deduction in a
proceSS, which defines the truth with the more accuracy, the
more perfectly both of its elements are blended in it. But sug-
gestion, the flash of truth inward upon the mind, when a great
principle is first seen as it stands illustrated in one application
· of it, is'the essence of induction. Therefore induct10n affords
us one of the happiest and most nearly complete analogies be·
tween the activity of the mental powers of genius and the activ-
ity of inspiration.

3. In inspiration the Moral and Free Activity of man is pen-
etrated and filled with the mo‘ral and free activity of God. If
we use the term conscience, in· its st-rictest meaning, and as
denoting the faculty of cognition when occupied with ethical
ideas and judgments, we must find in it the special organ and
seat of the divine activity in revelation. But if we include also

'under this term those original feelings and impulses which we ⁶

call ethical, we have in them the special organ and seat of inspi-
ration. Man’s moral freedom before the moral personality of
God is the door by which the Divine spirit wills to enter the
human spirit. Man becomes recipient of the divine sels-revela-
tion by the highest exercise of his own activity. That God
should be so in man, when revealing himself to man, as that
man shall be most free in yielding himself most fully to God, is

only the highest form of the mystery of human freedom. Man .

is not, then, best made subject of inspiration by stripping him
of his selfhood and laying him passive under the divine hand.
