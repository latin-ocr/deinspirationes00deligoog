240 THE J 0 URNAL OF CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPH Y.

His passivity in inspiration is the passivity of receptivity, the
activity which belongs to the sels-submission of saith. Just as
the quasi-ethical receptivity of the investigator of the truth of
physics is an activity‚ and a condition of the most fruitful activity‚
so the spiritual receptivity of faith is an inspired activity, and a
condition of receiving truth through revelation and inspiration.
F idelity, truth in the inward parts, is also an ethical act or state
which is the requisite of revelation, and may be the result of
inspiration.

From the foregoing statement we derive as our next principle,
the following: In all individual instances of revelation and in-
spiration‚ the individuality of the subject of revelation and inspi-
ration must be taken into the account. In biblical revelation
the circumstanceS, connectionS, and individual characteristics of
each prophet and apostle furnish grounds for various typeS, de-
grees, and grades of inspiration. The class characteristics of
the Hebrew mind furnish certain conditions to the nature of
the inspiration of the Old Testament. The revelation of tne
Old Testament is not less truly Hebraic because it is really
revelation and has elements which expand into the univer-
sality of Christianity. The inspiration of the Hebrew pro-
phet did not eradicate his race characteristica “Arabic life,”
says Renan following Lassen‚ “is a succession of hates and ven-
geances.’' It is to this same Semitic intensity that we owe the
characteristics of the inspired hatred of unrighteousness and the
inspired passion of devotion to Jehovah‚ which flame and breathe
through so many of the Hebrew writings. To the same cause
do we also owe some of the characteristic imperfections and
exaggerations to be met with in these writings. That “ superior
instinct’' and “ special sense'' for religion which Renan ascribes
to the Semitic peoples is by no means unconnected with the
inspiration which gave to the world the Hebrew monotheism.
The natural race characteristics do not account for the mono-
theism, but they are the explanation of the special form taken
by the inspiration which brought this monotheism forth. That
this law was not set aside by the revelation of Christianity, all
the phenomena of the New Testament most clearly evince.
But the mental constitution of its teachers and writers unites
with the changed character of the revelation to make the New
