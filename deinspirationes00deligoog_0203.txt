(† 1639) an‘d son († 1664), professors at Basle, on the one side, and
Leo Capellus on the· other. The former asserted both the an·
tiquity and divine origin of the vowel-points, as essential to any
- true doctrine of i nspiration. The latter claimed them ⁴as a later
growth upon the text, and appealed, *in confirmation of his view,
to both J ewish and· Christian testimonie& The orthodox opinion
was finally confirmed and formulated in the Formula Commu-9
Hebveticz‘ (1675), which declares that ‘ not only the consonante,
but also the vowels—either the points themselves, or at least the
meaning of the points—were inspired by God.’

It 1s undeniable, however, that some divines in the Reformed
churches entertained less rigid views. This was particularly true
of the French theologians of the school of Saumur, who could
admit, e.' g., without scruple, that the New Testament writers
had misapprehended the meaning of those of the⁴ Old, or had
fallen into errors of meinory. ’

-German Reformed theologsans also, like J unius Piscator and
others, were in like manner inclined to liberal vieva. In both the
French and Swiss Reformed churches the radical and rationalistic
views of Le Olerc generally found wide and welcome reception.
Pictet, e. g., professor at Geneva in 1702, taught that inspiration
in Scripture was limited to those truths which men can attain only
by the aid of revelation proper. The revelation, of course, never
extended to matter knowable by means of the natural facultieS.
For these, divine guidance in prevent-ing errors was amply suffi-
cient.

A reaction against the exaggerated orthodoxy and extreme lit·
eralism of the ‚Protestant theologians was inevitable‚ and actually

appeared in various quartem. We notice first the Roman Cath-
olics.

1. The Oanons of Trent incidentally refer to the Scriptures as
a ‘dictation of the Holy Ghost,’ but determine nothing otherwise
concerning the theory of inspiration. Ecclesiastical opinion,
however, practically declared that the Scriptures and their author-

ity were dependent upon and subordinate to the authority of the
church.
