2. Inspiration is preeminently an ethical affair. This we must
affirm, whether we consider chiefly its product in revelation, its
final purpose in the Kingdom of Redemption, the pre-condi-
tions in its recipient which limit its existence and completeneSS,
or the nature and activity of the faculties which are most influ-
entially affected by it.

3. Inspiration is dynamica13 and therefore involves the illum-
ining, purifying, and quickening, by the Divine Spirit‚ of all those
mental faculties of man which enter into the work of revelation.
The general conception of inspiration is that of a divine influ-
ence, coming like breath or wind, or some other fluid, into the
soul of man, and producing there a transforming effect. God’s
Spirit is regarded as operating within man's spirit, to awaken,
quicken, enliven, elevate, illumine, and instruct, the facultieS.
The man is therefore to be spoken of as moved, or breathed
upon, or taught, or made wise‚ by God. Its phenomena do not
comprise anything within the mind which is foreign to the mind’s
own powers: they consist solely in the unusual form or energy
of the activity of normal mental powers. Inspiration is, then,
to be conceived of as dynamical rather than as constructive,
mechanical‚ or merely regulative‚ What might be called a regu-
lative divine influence does indeed enter into that complex men-‘-
tal condition which we call inspiration; but, as distinguished
from the dynamical‚ the regulative is only the providential ac·-
tivity of the Holy Spirit. To Providence we are to ascribe
much of that specific divine influence which the older theology
made an integral part of inspiration under the term impulsus ad
scribendum.. But, if the divine activity in inspiration is more
and higher than that which is merely regulative‚ it is less, tho'ugh
not ethically lower, than the⁴ mechanical, or constructive. A
purely mechanical theory of inspiration is such a self-contradict-
ory and absurd theory that it cannot even be put into terms
which will represent it to the human mind. All such theorieS,
however, as unduly emphasize the passivity of the mind under
inspiration, and repress its activity according to its own laws,
may be called more or less mechanical. They all speak of in-
spiration as though God could treat the human mind like a ma-
chine. To such theories expressions which exalt the passivity
of the writers of Scripture are favorite—as‚ for example, ‘⁴ nota·-
