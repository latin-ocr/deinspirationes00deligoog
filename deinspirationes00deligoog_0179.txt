composition as a human art.¹ Viewing them as intrinsically un-
important, he yet finds in them valnable evidence of the trust-
worthiness of the writers in all essentia] factS.2

c. Jerome († 420) entertained similar ideas. He had no hesi·
tation in acknowledging peculiarities of expression and concep-
tion, and differences in less weighty matters among the apostleS.
These are of purely human, not of divine origin. He finds vae
rious literary defects in Paul’s epistles, and more than these, some
traces of a spirit not altogether Christian. Yet he views the whole
human side of the Scriptures as subserving in God‘s providentia]
order important apologetic endS.

c. Augustine, speaking of the minor differences of the Evan-
gelists, says: ‘⁶ It is evident that they have set forth these matters
just in accordance with the recollection which each retained of

to employ greater brevity or richer detail.”⁸

d. Quite in the same line do Theodore of Mopsuestia († 429)
‚and Theodoret, among the Antiochian church·teachers, affirm
characteristic peculiarities in the human authors of Scripture, and
in their methods of conceiving truth.

e. Basil the Great († 37 9) compares the sacred writers to mir-
rorS, whose surfaces, according to the degree of their polish and
clearness, condition the reception and reflection of the imageS.

5. From what has been already said, especially from the extracts
given, one may form a general idea of patristic views as to the
nature of inspiration in the fourth, fifth, and following centurieS.
From these views there were, in the case of individuals, notable
deviatione. ¹

a. Theodore of Mopsuestia looked at the inspira-tion of the sacred
books chiefly from the humant point of view. He maintained, in
regard to the writings of SoIomon, i. e., ProverbS, Ecclesiastes and
Canticles, that their author had not the gift of propkoeffi but only
that of wz’sdom. The Song of Songs was a merely human writing
-an offensive poem of Solomon’s, composed on the occasion of his
illegal marriage with an Egyptian princeSS. Theodore dealt very
