proph'aoy formed the point of departure in all discussions of
this age uponthe nature of the inspiration of the sacred books.¹

[It is worthy of note, 1n passing, that Rudelbach, in common
with various other orthodox writerS‚ has made labored, though ·
ineffectual attempts‚² to clear -Justin Martyr and other early
fathers from the charge of holding essentially heathen ideas
upon the nature of inspiration. He seeks to explain away the
inferences naturally drawn from their use of the figure of mus-

ecstasy a fundamental clement of prophecy, nor teach a motion-

development of the doctrine of inspiration, is stronger than the

true historic instinct]

The view thus indicated of prophetie inspiration, as presup-
posing a passive state of absolute receptivity‚ continued in the

century. It reached §s climax and wrought its own ruin in
the fanatical excesses of Montanism‚ when God-sent madness
or insanity was demanded as the test of the true prophet. ‚
The subject of inspiration here sank into a state of delirium and
took leave of his senses3 his spirit slept under the sole and

loses his sensation (eoecidat sensu), because 116 is overshadowed'
with the power of God.”⁵ N itzsch thus comments: “ The Mon-
tanists¹ sought in ecstasy as a supernatural medium of the concep-
tion of the divine, at the same time the satisfaction of a kind of
mystical voluptuousness3 and, moreover, this is to them, not only
