The Holy Ghost used the sacred penmen as reasonable crea-
tureS. and made use of their judgrnents‚ memories and affection&
but they acted under his gnidance in the whole of their work.

4. Doddridqe.

Doddridge (†17 51) distinguished different kinds or degrees of
inspiration, after the manner of Whitby.

a. Inspiration of Superintendence.

This implies such a direction of the mind of a human writer
of the Scriptures‚ that he is made more secure from error than
he could have been by the mere use of his natural facultieS.

aided powers, The absolute truth of contents‚ both as to fact
and doctrine, implies full inspiration‚ though the words, phrases,
and manner be left to the human author, and imperfection of
style and method be the result. In a book intended to teach truth
for practical endS‚ such defects furnish no warrant for rejecting

spiration.² ’

b. Inspiration of Elevation.

Where this occurs, such elevation of human powers is implied
