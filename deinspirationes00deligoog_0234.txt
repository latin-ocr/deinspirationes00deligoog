New Testament as a pattern for our guidance: e. g. community

Only the general practice of the church is exemplary for perma-
nent guidance.¹ .

He does not view possible or actual contradictions in chrono-
logical and historical details as harmful, unless of such a kind as
to affect the substance of revelation, i. e. to distort our apprehen·

sion of Christ’s person, or disturb the fundamental basis of
revealed truth.'

6. ΠΟ man.

This divine was inclined to a free construction of the doctrine
of inspiration.¹ He regarded the limitation of the idea to Scrip-
ture as unwarranted and arbitrary, and would himself extend it to
heathen writings and poete. He said that the doctrine of inspira-
tion was nothing else than a ‘ conclusion-backward ' (Riickschluss)
from the character of the Scriptures to their oriqz‘n. From this
view also resulted the theory of its infallibility. He would not
himself admit that the teaching of any single apostle was abso-
lutely free from error3 much less could any one portraiture of
Christ adequately set forth the full glory of its subject. He did
affirm, however, that the collective preaching of the apostles con-
tained the conditions of an absolutely errorless apprehension of
Christ. (Compare Martensen above.) The Bible, accordingly, is
not wholly free from error, but it is the perfectly sufficient instru-
ment for attaining an absolutely infallible knowledge of divine
revelation, since it contains within itself the means of self-
purification from the errors clinging to its individua] parts: i. e.
it contains the means of self-correction. This is its actual infalli-
bility, and herein also lies its sufficiency.⁴

high Lutheran) is in reality modern, not dating back even to the
Reformation.
