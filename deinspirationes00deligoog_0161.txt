in the Law, nor dare any prophet give utterance to anything
which is not founded on the same. All indeed which the
prophets afterwards 'predicted was already beforehand revealed
frqllsslesffiffiss is called Holy Scripture absolutely, the other writings
attain a like dignity only from their constituent relation to this,¹

2. Pro hetia.
All thgD other books of the Old Testament, though divinely

ς revealed, must take a second rank.2 This results from the fact

that they reveal nothing new in substance, but simply teach the
correct understanding and explanation of the Law. The differ-
ence of the two classes of writings was illustrated by the saying
that 4 Moses looked upon a clear mirror, other prophets upon one
whose surface was dim '3 or, that ‘ he looked through one, other
prophets through several vmirrors.'-3 N otwithstanding this lower
degree of inspiration and consequent inferiority of rank, Palestin-
ian J ewish theology insisted upon the inclusion of the Prophets
and Hagiographa with the Law in ‘ Holy Scripture.’ Those
who denied the claim were branded as apostates from Israel.

It was not held that the process of inspiration in these writers
annihilated their human personality and made them unconscious
organs of the Spirit.³ It did not even obliterate diversities of gisus,
or peculiarities of literary style by which the productions of one
might be distinguished from those of another. Apparently, more
pronounced individuality was conceded to the writers of the his-
torical books than to the prophets strictly so called.

11. Alexandrian judaism.

Very different was the case with Alexandrian J udaism. Seem-

of the miraculous origin of the Septuagint translation. Aristeas,
followed by Philo and J osephus, relates that Ptolemy Philadel-
phus summoned seventy-two rabbins from Palestine to make a
translation of the sacred vbooks from the Hebrew original into
