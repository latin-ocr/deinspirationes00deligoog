86 'run Doc'mmn oF INSPIRATION:

V. French orthodoxy.

Modern French orthodoxy with reference to the doctrine of
inspiration finds its chief representatives in Gasparin and Gaussen.
Both have published treatises which have been translated into
English.¹ Other writers have taken much more moderate vieWS.

1. Goeassen.

This divine († 1863) taught the absolute inspiration and divinity
of the Scriptures in every part—including form as well as sub-
stance, expression as well as matter. He says: “The word of God
is Grod speaking in man, God speaking by man, God speaking
as man, God speaking for man.’'

⁰ In regard to Paul's -assertion that “ all Scripture is given by
inspiration of God‚ &c.‚” he remarks: ‘⁶ It admits of no restric-
tion; it is the whole Scriptura, all that is written (πᾶσα γραφή)-
,that is to say, the thoughts that have already put on the clothing
of language. It admits of no restriction3 all Scripture is so far
3 work of God that it is represented as given to us by the breath
.'of God‚ in the same manner as the word of a man is given by the
breath of his mouth. The prophet is the mouth of the Most
High.'’ ² Again: ‘⁶ The entire Bible is not only named the ‘ Word
of God ' (ὁ λόγος τοῦ θεοῦ), it is called without distinction, the
‘ Oracles of God' (τὰ λόγια τοῦ θεοῦ). Who does not know what the
oracles were in the opinion of the· ancients‘l Was there then a
single word which could express more absolutely a complete and
verbal inspiration ’ἔ ” ³
· Gaussen professes to admit, and tries to illustrate the preserva-
tion of the individuality of the sacred writers when under the
influence of inspiration. He repudiates all notion of the state of
ecstasy‚ and maintains their sels-control. He yet refers all differ-
ences in biblical accounts of the same transaction‚ and indeed all
the human as well as the divine phenomena‚ to the Holy Ghost as
their author. Immediate and universal divine efficiency, and co-
existent human freedom and individuality‚ he affirms. To reconcile
or explain the two, he finds of course a very different matter.
