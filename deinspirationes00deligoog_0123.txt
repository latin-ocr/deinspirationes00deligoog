ready to be issued on a certain day. What was the result!
Why, men offered five hundred dollars to get a copy of that
Book a little in advance of its publication3 and the morning it
was published the streets of New York were blockaded with
express wagons backed up and waiting for copies of that Book
which had been refuted, exploded, and dead and buried for so
many years. Millions of copies of that Book were sold as fast
as they could be delivered. They telegraphed' the whole of that

Book from New York to ChicagO, for the sake of getting it there 'to ’

print in 8 newspaper twenty-four hours in advance of the mail.

A dead book, is it? They would not pay s or telegraphing the
greatest infidel speech ever delivered in this country, from here
to Tophet. This old Book seems to show some signs of lise yet.
It is like Aaron'e rod that budded and blossomed‚ and is being
scattered all over the world.

This Book outlives its foes. If you could gather all the books
written against it, you could build a pyramid higher than
Bunkpr Hill Monument. Now and then a man goes to work to
refute the Bible; and every time it is done, it has to be done
over again the next day or the next year. And then, after its
enemies have done their worst, some of its professed friends
torture and twist and mystify and misrepresent it. Surely it is
no fool of a book if it lives through all that. Infidels have
been at work for nearly eighteen hundred years, firing away at
it, and. making about as much impression upon it as you would

shooting boiled peas at Gibralter. [Laughter and applause.].

The fact ie, this Book has come into the world, and it seems to
have come to stay. It is in the world, and Ι do not know how
you are to get it out. One hundred years ago you might have
found that Book in twenty or thirty translation83 but now you
can find it in from between two and three hundred different
versione, most of which have been made in this last progressive,
intellectual, nineteenth century. All over the globe it goes;
touch any shore and you will find that Book there before you.

And it is a curious fact that most of our skeptical friends con·
trive to keep very close to where its shadow falls. It does not
take 8 great while to get out of sight of the Bible. You can go,
in a very few days, where there are no churches, Sunday-schools,
