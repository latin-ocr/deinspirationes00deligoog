AN OUTLINE ms'rochL sTUDY. 49

Calovius supported the same theory ‚by the declaration that
⁴ not one jot or tittle should in any wise pass from the Law.’
Similarly speak Quenstedt and Hollaz.

It thus appears, to speak briefiy, that the Lutheran divines of
this period regarded every word and every letter of the Scrip- ‚
tures as the direct atteram& and work-of the Holy θήσει.

It could hardly escape the notice of these Protestant scholastics
that the views propounded and defended by them encountered‘
many difficulties, and were liable to serious objections; but theo-
logical ingenuity and acuteness ,were then, as alwayS‚ ready with
a plausible answer.

a. When it was asked how on this basis the evident differences
of style among the sacred writers were to be accounted for, Cal-
ovius said plainly: “The cause of different methods of expres-
sion is that the Holy spirit makes each one to speak just as he
wishes.¹

Quenstedt and Hollaz point to the manifoldness of the con-
tents of the Scripture which, they say, demands a corresponding
variety of style. They also assume an accommodation on the
part· of the Holy Ghost to the individual peculiarities of the sa-
cred writerS,² making him thereby the cleverest of imitators.

A somewhat fuller form of reply to this objection was
that the Holy Ghost, as the Lord of all ‚gifts of utterance‚ could
speak as he would, and vary his style according to his pleasure.
In 'dictating to each sacred writer, he chose just such methods of

. expression as that person would have chosen had he been writing

under a voluntary impulse. ‘So carefully did the divine author
adapt himself to the individuality and the grade of culture of
each one.

b. To the charge of barbarisms or solecisms in style, a flat de-
nial was returned.

Hollaz declares: ‘⁶ The style of the sacred Scriptures is dighi-
fied, worthy of the divine Majesty, and is disfigured by no gram-
matica] fault, by no barbarism or solecism. To maintain the .
contrary is blasphemy.”
