owed by others of greater apparent importance. The strictest
ideas prevailed both as to its nature and extent, but these were
based upon merely mechanica] assent to the statementsof earlier
fathers, and not upon any intelligent and impartial investigatione

. of the facts and teachings of the sacred records themselves.

There was axrelapse toward the ideas and views of paganism and

doctrines of theology, that of inspiration seemed to suffer a well-

appears from the fact that nOW, as at the very first among the
Apologists‚ prophecy formed the great centre around which the ·
whole conception turned. ⁴

The utterances of the Mediaeval theologians on inspiration are
so feW, vague and disjointed as to be incapable of classification
under proper headings. we must be content here to state the
views of a few authors in chronological order.

ture as interchangeable terms and says :¹ ‘⁶ By the Holy Ghost,
