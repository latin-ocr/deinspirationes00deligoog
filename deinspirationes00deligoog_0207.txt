AN OUTLIN E HISTORICAL STUDY. 55

The promise that the Spirit should ‘guide the disciples into all
truth‚ &c.‚' (John 16: 1.3‚) was explained as teaching that divine
aid would be given to strengthen the ⁸²memory, and make needed
explanatione of truth. The apostles did not claim inspiration or
deem it necessary to the validity of the doctrinal contents of their
writings.

The views of Le Clerc here had much in common with those
of Spinoza.

It thus appears that the Arminian view of inspiration implied
a great relaxation of the strictness of the general Protestant
church doctrine3 among other things, greatly widening the field
of spontaneity and conscious personal activity on· the part of the

sacred writers.

V. Socinian.

· The Socinians did not by any means deny the fact of inspira-

tion, but were otherwise grossly inconsistent in their views. The ¹

Racovian Catechism (preface) teaches 'that ‘the Holy Ghost dic-
tated the matter of Scripture to the apostles‚ and sometimes the
very wordS‚ so that they were his mere instruments? Inspiration
is conceived as the immediate and coercive operation of an out-

· side Power upon the sacred writers, rather than the inter-pene-

tration of their personality by a higher Influence‚ and thus the
sels-conscious elevation of their human faculties to apprehend the
divine truth a'nd will. Socinianism here occupies common ground
with High Lutheran and Reformed orthodoxy.

1. Faustus Socinus himself confesses that the authors of Scrip-

ture wrote ‘under the impulse of t-he divine spirit and ‚at his ,

dictation‚’ ¹ yet he elsewhere says that the ‘ natural ahilities of the
N ew‘ Testament writers were abundantly sufficient for the com-
munication of doctrine‚’ under which he would include only the
most weighty practica] truths.² He limits inspiration to essential
things, and admits without scruple slight errors of memory, which ·
do not in any way affect the truth of the sacred narrative. So-
cinus has no hesitation in exalting the New Testament above the
Old, and in declaring that ‘the reading of the latter, while use-
ful, is by no means necessary.’
