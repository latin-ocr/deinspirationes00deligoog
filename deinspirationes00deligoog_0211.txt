character. Burnet sayS, expressly: “ When the divine writers
argue upon any point, we are always bound to believe the conclu-
sions that their reasonings end in,‚as parts of divine revelation3
but we are not bound to be able to make out, or 'even to assent to
all the premises made use of by them in their whole extent3 un-
less it appears plainly that they affirm the premises as expressly <
as they do the conclusions proved by them.” ¹

Richard Baxter († 1691), among the dissenting divines of Eng-
land in the seventeenth century, is noteworthy for his somewhat
latitudinarian position on the question before us, He would limit
inspiration to the subject-matter of Scripture. He, says: ‘⁶ The
Scripture is like a man’s body, where some parts are but for the
preservation of the rest, and may be maimed without death. The
sense is the soul of Scripture, and the letters but the body or ve-
hicle. The doctrine of the Creed, Lord’s Prayer, and Decalogue
. is the vital part, and Christianity itself. The Old Testalnent let—
ter (written as we have it about Ezra’s time) is that vehicle, which ’
is as imperfect as the Revelation. of these times was. But as
after Christ’s incarnation and ascension‚ the spirit was more
abundantly given, and the Revelation more perfect and sealed,
so the doctrine is more full, and the vehicle or body, that is, are
less imperfect and more sure to us3 so that he that doubteth of
the truth of some words in the Old Testament, or of some cir-
cumstances iu the N ew, hath uo reason to doubt therefore of the
Christian religion, of which these doctrines are but the vehicle
or body, sufficient to ascertain of the truth of the IIistory and
Doctrine.'’ ²

Very different from the attitude of Baxter was that occupied
by the Puritan divine, John Owen († 1683), who was quite in ac-
cord upon this subject withthe Lutheran and Reformed scholas-
tics of the Continent, aud may be taken as an example of the ex-
tremely rigid views prevalent among most of the contemporary
