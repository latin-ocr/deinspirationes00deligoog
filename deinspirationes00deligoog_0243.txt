This may be true, and yet it may not be difficult to form reason-
ably distinct impressione as to his general ideas. According to
'the same authority, he found and acknowledged in the Bible an
oracle from God, a positive and supernatura] revelation made to
man, an immediate inspiration of the Spirit.¹

Many utterances on the subject of inspiration are found in his
‘ Sermone on the Christian Life: Its· Oourse, Hindrances and
Helps.’ Thus he says: ‘⁶ Paul had the Spirit of Grod so abun-
dantly that no human being ever enjoyed a larger share,’' and
askS, “ Are not his writings most truly to be called inspiredZ Can
any reasonable mind doubt that to refuse to believe his testimony
is really to disbelieve Grod ’ἔ ” ²

While Arnold holds, however, that the Scriptures are divinely
framed and superintended‚ he would not have his saith depend on
the accuracy of a date or a minute historica] particular.⁸ He calls
it an unwarranted interpretation of the term ‘ inspiration,' to
believe that it is equivalent to a communication of divine perfec-
tions.⁴ In whatever points errors may be discernible in Scripture,
either it does not concern what God has done for us, or what we
are to do for him3 or, if it seems to do 80, Grod has made some
provision for the case, to remove what it might otherwise have
had of difficulty. .

The following utterances will convey some idea of his views as
to the eaetent of the divine influence upon the minds of the sacred
writers: “ Inspiration does not raise a man above his own time,
or make him, even in respect to that which he utters when
inspired, perfect in wisdom and goodness3 but it so overrules his
lang-uage that it shall contain a meaning more than his own mind
was conscious of, and thus give to it a character of divinity and a
power of perpetual application.'’ ⁶
