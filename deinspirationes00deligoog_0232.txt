4. Bothe.

Bothe († 1867 ) maintained with eteadfast determination the
revealed character of Christianity. He did indeed abandon the

old theory of inspiration, but only to undertake its scientific recon-

etruction on what seemed to him more eure foundations.'

the word, for inspiration does not relate to literary activity. It ie
not a religione text-book, but rather a historical record, which, as a
constituent part of revelation,⁴ must be penetrated and surrounded
by the peculiar atmosphere of the same, i. e., by the divine breath
· which it inhalee. Nevertheleee, from ite historic character it mnst

historica] criticism respecting the canon as a whole, and the canon-
icity of single parte3 for the great revolution in religione knowledge
which characterizee' modern times finde the foundation and centre
of Christianity, not in a book, but in a pereo& not in a doctrinal
' system, but in facte and deeds, i. e., in history.⁶
