AN OUTLIN E HISTORIOAL STUDY. 15

¹Origen's testimony is peculiarly clear· and explicit. In the
preface to his treatise De Principii-8, (c. 4), he says: ‘⁶ That
this Spirit inspired each one of the saintS, whether prophete or
apostles, and that there was not one Spirit in the men of the old
dispensation, and another in those who were inspired at the advent
of Christ, is most clearly taught throughout the churchesss’

Cyril of J e1 usalem living at the end of our period, maintained
’ that the same Spirit spoke through prophets and apostles: “Let
no man divide the Old from the New Testament, or say that the
Spirit' 1n one is different from the S p1r1t in the other, else he
offends against the Holy Ghost himself. ”¹

Much more testimony to the same effect, both direct and indi-
rect, might be drawn from the ante· N 1cene writers, but it seems
unnecessary.

Thus not only did the ante-Nicene church acknowledge the unity
and equality of the inspiration of the Old and N ew TestamentS, but
various circumstances conspired to increase the emphasis placed
upon it. Ohief among thes'e was the opposition of the Gnostics,
who either wholly rejected the Old Testament, maintaining that
it was inspired by the Demiurge3 or, as Irenaeus says of the
Valentinians, ascribed great difference in character, not only ,to
the prophetic books, but even to the discourses of Christ, accord-
ing as they were inspired by higher or lower, more or less perfect
spiritual principles. ’

111. Extra-Canonical Inspiration.

Destructive critics have made much of the fact that the idea
of inspiration was not strictly limited by the early church-fathers
to the⁴ canonical writingS, but was extended by some to the
apochryphal books of the Old Testament, and to post-apostolic
Christian writings. We see, for example, that—

Justin Martyr and Theophilus attributed inspiration to the
Sibylline books, and those of the Persian Hystaspes Clement
of Alexandria († cir. 220) appears to hold that every extraordinary
talent and all knowledge of the true and good is the result of
divine infiuence—is inspired. He also says that among heathen
