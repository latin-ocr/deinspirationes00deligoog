respect from that possessed in common by all men as a gift from
the Almighty, and manifested in the ordinary exercise of the
moral and rational nature. He therefore made· the essence of
inspiration to consist simply in the fact that the sacred writerS‚ in
the spirit of piety, referred to God their good thoughts and ideaS,
and recorded them under divine guidance and assistance.¹

2. De Wctte.

This theologian († 1849) says: ‘⁶ The biblica} doctrine of inspi-
ration does not imply the superstitious notion of an influence of
the Holy Ghost upon the sacred writers, abrogating the laws of
nature, nor the exaggerated extension of inspiration to all things
and everything in the Scriptures‚ nor yet the admission of their
unconditional and unlimited infallibility.

“ The essential idea is rather the religious sense of the divine

working, or of the Holy spirit, in the sacred writers, and this , · ἢ

indeed solely in regard to their belief and elevation of soul, not in
regard to their formation of ideas. It bore relation to historic

· tmth, only in so far as its knowledge was dependent upon a holy

love of truth.'' ²
Baur criticises this as the familiar phraseology with which
rationalism seeks to conceal the shallowness of its views²¹

⁹ 11. Schleiermacher.

Schleiermacheff († 1834) gave up the old ecclesiastica] theory of
inspiration‚ and advocated views which formed on the whole its
direct antithesis, These views‚ utterly unsound from the stand-
point of orthodoxy‚ were yet thought to mark essentia] progr-ess
in the history of the doctrine.

Schleiermacher taught:

1. That the Spirit by which the Scriptures are inspired is not
the persona] Holy Ghost‚ but rather the ‘ genius' of Christianity
individualizing itself in the sacred writers, and related to them as
the general to the particular. This theologian promptly dismisses
every question as to the more exact relation of this Holy Ghost to
the Third Person of the Trinity.
