The Doctrine of Inspiration:

An Outlz'ne Hz‘storz'cal Study. .

INTRODUCTION.

The accompanying sketch does not aim to present a complete
critical history of the Doctrine of Inspiration. It simply embod·
ies the results of some special studieS‚ which may be ‘of interest in
view of current biblical and theological discussione.

It will be noticed that the method of treatment is not uniform.
Somewhat frequent changes of plan were necessitated by the
varying nature and amount of the material at command. In the
latter part of the essay it has been deemed advisable to allow
writers to speak, partially at least, for themselves, though great
condensation has been necessary in order to bring detailed state-
ments within a reasonable compass

The author feels it due to himself· to state that while he has

endeavored to keep this sketch‚ as far 38 possible, free from ⁸

subjective coloring, his personal convictions and sympathies are
wholly in the direction of conservative orthodox opinions.

The scieuce of Comparative Religion teaches that many ideas
commonly associated with Christianity alone, and supposed to be
its exclusive property, really belong to man as a religious being.
No matter how rude the concept-iou or imperfect the expres-
sion, they enter into every form of saith, and are co‘e‘xtensive with
a belief in Deity. In other systems they voice deep needs of
human souls and earnest though impotent efforts to supply them ;
