Tertullian declared that the apostles were made possessors of
the salnes-9 of the Holy Ghost, while all others shared his gifts
only in measure} This would probably express the general judg-
ment of the ancient church concerning his divine relation to the
different classes of writingS.²

IV. T he' Nature of Inspiration.

No formal definition of inspiration‚ nor any connected sys-
tematic doctrine of the same was established during the period
with which we are now concerned.

At the very first, the church seems to have contented herself
with the conviction of the apostolic authority of the authors,
and the conceded truth of the contents of the sac'red books.
Soon, however, questionings began'to arise respecting the nature
of the divine influence under which the various writers did their
work. Two diverging views were developed among the ante-
N icene fathers.

1. The first *and stricter one waS‚ as is evident, of heathen
origin, and was mixed up with ideas of heathen soothsaying.
Starting from the idea of the prophet as the interpreter of Deity‚

of a long array of reputedly able and orthodox writers on inspiration in the
church of the eighteenth and nineteenth centurieS, whose ideas upon this point

are certainly confused.
