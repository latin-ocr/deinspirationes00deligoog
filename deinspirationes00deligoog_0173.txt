⁸ to it. He avoids the sensuous comparisons employed by the
Apologists, and thus escapes their errors.

Origen made at least a first approach to a more exact definition
of the nature and process of inspiration, understanding by it not
the mere inpouring of foreign thought⁰s, but an elevation of the
natural powers of the soul through the touch of the Holy Ghost.

Though he expresses doubts upon some important points, e. g.,
whether inspiration extends to every passage of the word of God‚
yet his lieart and the general tenor of his teaching was true at

the prophets‚ nor in the apostolic writings is there anything
which has not its origin in the fulness of the divine Majesty.'’

The same general· view was maintained by his pupils and suc-

V. Degrees of Inspiration.

We have seen above, that both Palestinian and Alexandrian
J udaism distinguish degrees in inspiration. The same thing is
done by some of the ante-Nicene fathers, though from a different

the Lord.’ He values the gospels more highly than the epistles,
because, though ,J esus and Paul were both filled with the Holy
Ghost, the vessel of the latter was much smaller than that of
the former.¹ He speaks of the apostolic writings as ‘ full of
wisdom and tmstworthy,’ but doubts whether Paul intended to
range his own under the head of ‘ Scripture given by inspiration
of Godss (2 Tim. 3: 16). He calls attention to the fact that Paul
makes a difference in the Second Epistle to the Corinthiam,
between what he said in Itis own cpim‘t, and in tlte spirit of
Christ. The former u'tteranceS, he says, ‘are spoken under
divine impulse, and have authority and weight, but are not to be
