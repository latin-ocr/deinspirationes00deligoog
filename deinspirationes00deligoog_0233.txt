to which the Christian church traces its origin.²

The miracle 01 inspiration took place on the day 01 Ρο11100001,
and was the breaking forth 01 1110 Spirit 01 God within the spirit
01 111011. The gift 01 tongues was essentially a state 01 ecstasy, but
this did not constitute inspiration. It was only its accompaniment‚

and as it were a shell or husk, within which was contained, and Α

0111 01 which proceeded the clear and 111010110οΙ *consciousness 01
revelation.²

Inspiration in the primitive age was not confined exclusively to ἡ
1110 011001100, but (distinguishing degrees in the same) was bestowed
upon 1110111 111 110 salmes 101· 111011 official work as founders 01 the

In the Holy Scriptures Martensen finds the ripened fruit 01
inspiration. He would emphasize both the unicm and the dis-
tinction 01 1110 divine and human elements contained therein:⁰
