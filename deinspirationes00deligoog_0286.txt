constant experience of the community of believers in their com·
munion with God. It is, however, the divine communication of
the permanent truths of the Kingdom of Redemption, in an
organie way, to the writers of the Bible, which gives to these
writers their unique place in the offiees of this Kingdom. In
other words, when we wish to characterize the permanent and
organic factors in the Bible, we refer them to the work of the
Spirit of revelation within the personality of its authors,

Revelation and inspiration‚ as the subjective condition of
revelation, are factors of the Word of God. The specific nature
of that inspiration which is the subjective condition of biblical
revelation, and which is, therefore, the predicate of the entire
true Word of God, may'be further defined, in conclusion, by
the following statement of particulars. The proofs of this state·
ment lie only partially in the views of the supernatural, of reve-
lation, and of inspiration in general, which have preceded it.
They also largely consist in the results of an extended inductive
examination of all the claimS, and of all the principal classes of
the phenomena, of the Bible. The proofs, then, so far as they
have not already been introduced cannot be given; and the
statement must be given, separated in part from its proofs, and
left to prove itself‚ or to fail of credence, according to the test-
ing of the reader.

1. Inspiration, in the primary and only strictly appropriate
meaning of the word, applies to personality. For this reason
’ does Dorner justly complain of ’ the older theory of supernatu-
ralism, because it violently sundered the divine activity in the
composition of the Scriptures from inspiration in its original
meaning, according to which not bookS‚ but men, are inspired.
Inspiration involves the cooperation of two spiritual and per-
sonal agencieS, of an imparting and inspiring Divine Spirit, and
a recipient yet active human spirit. Books and writings can no
more than stocks and stones be of themselves inspired. The
predicate of inspiration can, then, be applied to the immediate
product of inspired personal activity, to the Divine Word, only
in a secondary and derived meaning. Of an inspiration which
can be thought of as detached from personality, or regarded as
ad scribendum or in scribenda, neither the claims of the Bible, nor
any tenable dogmaticS, give us any account.
