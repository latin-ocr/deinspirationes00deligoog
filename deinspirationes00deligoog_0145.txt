same law ‘of sevena manifeste itself in the process of ‘restora-
tion. His sever runs seven days, and then turns; or ir nature
is not able to recover herself at that point, the struggle goes
on for another seven day& and if the sever does not then turn, it
must run another seven dws. Fevers do not turn on the fourth,
or fifth, or sixth day. All the doctors and skeptics in creation
cannot make severs turn, as 8 rule, except at the seventh day.
This shows that the law of sevens is so wrought into the
very constitution of man, that he cannot escape its control. It
is a part' of himself3 and whether he believes it or disregards
it, he is still bound by this universal law. The human constitu-

tion is like an eight-day clock. It needs to be wound up reg- .

ularly oneo a weok, and the dayqf rest affords opportunity of doing
it. And any one who will study the constitution of mankind,
will find that this law, dividing human life into periods of one,
tw0, three, and fem· sevens of days, is anniversal law, controlling
human existence from its beginning to its end.

 

When we consider that Moses was the founder of the first
national mnam-y system of which we have record3 the founder
of the first republican government which the world has ever
known, the United States of Israe13 the organizer of the first
nation that worshiped the only true a'nd hving God, in the
midst of world-wide idolatries and defilements3 the founder of
the first total abstinence society of which history makes record
(Num. vi.); the giver of a system of laws which, while all the
other laws of antiqnity are lost in oblivion or buried in con-
tempt, is so founded on the immutable rinciples of truth and
righteousness that it lies at the basis οὲ) 811 modern civil gov-
ernment, and has so ruled and molded the character of the J ew-
ish nation, that gray-headed judges on the bench and lawyers at
the bar, declaro that in their whole lives they have never seen a
J ew arraigned for crime, -we may well inquire whether, after all,
the career of Moses was such a gross mistake.

In Great Britain, where skeptieism widely prevails, and “the
mistakes of Moses’' are discussed in club-rooms, beer-shops, and
gin-palaces, one person in eve desen is said to be a lunatio, a
mminaL a pauper, or a muham . Would not the teachings of
MoseS, in spite of all his alleged ‘⁴ mistakes,’' go far to remedy
the wreek and ruin which has been wrought there by intem-

peranee‚ viee, and crime 8*
