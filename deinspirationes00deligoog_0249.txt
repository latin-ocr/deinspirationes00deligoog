¹ Among the latest works written from this point 01 view, is that
01 Walter R. Browne on ‘The Inspiration 01 1118 New Testa-
ment. '²

This author distinguishes three distinct states 01 inspiration in
the writers 01 Scriptum, as follows:

“ Direct Inspiration, when the writer is merely transcribing „
a revelation from God, made immediately to himself3 and even in
the transcription has a supernatura] power working in and con-
trolling him.

b. Indirect Inffiration, when the same controlling power oper-
3188, but when the matter recorded, although supernatural, is
known to the writer, mainly at least, by the ordinary channels 01
111101111311011. Τ1118 11131181 may be either supernatura] words (as in
the case 01 Christ’s discourses given in the gospels), or else merely
supernatural deedS, or arrangements3 and the extent and nature
01 1118 controlling power will be different in these different cases,

To distinguish classes (a) and (b), we may say briefiy that the
writer is in the first a mssenyer, in the second, a historiam

c. Preventime Inspiraticm, when the matters are wholly within
the writer's knowledge, and at the same time 01 110 immediate
supernatural import, being in general a mere filling in 01 details
Here the writer will simply be 1811 10 himself, to tell his story in
his own way3 and the only work of inspiration will be to prevent
the introduction 01 any serious error, such as could not be detected
by the readers 01 13181 generations, and might produce evil results''’

Some general similarity 01 view, at least upon the question en·
gaging our attention, may be detected in the writings 01 1118 sev-
eral divines now to be mentioned.
