2. Priestly.

Dr. Priestly († 1808) holds us bound 10 001181ᾶο1 1110 great
truths uttered by the apostles as from God—divine, and worthy
01 1110 highest regard. He judges us not bound, however, to
accord like saith to the minutiae 01 what they mention, nor to
their arguments and reasonings either from facts or revealed
doctrines,

3. Heber.

Bishop Heber († 1826) declares¹ that ‘ mistakes in points where
inspiration does not properly apply, can by no means derogate
from the inspired character 01 a work, in those respects where
inspiration is either needed or promised.' He also says that ‘cir-
cumstances which, whether true or false, have no positive bearing
on the doctrine or character 01 Christ, may belong indeed 10 1118
history, but are 110 essential parts 01 1110 gospel.’ The bishop
insists that th‘e words (ff Christ are reported by the evangelists

with supernatura] and infallible authority.
4. Parry. χ

W1n. Parry († 1818) endeavored to prove that there was
no necessity for inspiration or immediate divine suggestion 01
what the apostles knew already, either from the discourses of
Christ or their own observation. The Holy Spirit taught them
all things respecting Christianity, 01 which they were not previ-
ously in possession—the whole 01 that wliyz‘ous tram which it
was necessary 101 1110111 10 103011, or for men to know. Since he
preserved them from all error in what they taught and recorded,
the same result is secured as though he had dictated every syllable
01 111011 writings. If they had been mere machines under his
direction, they could in no case have given to men more than a
perfect ναῖε as to all religious opinions and dutieS, all matters 01
131111 and practice. But such a perfect rule we have in the N ew
Testament, if we consider the writers as under the Spirit's infalli-
ble guidance in all the religious sentiments they express, whether
he suggested the very words in which they are written or not.²
