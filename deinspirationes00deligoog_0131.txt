an infidel paper which was published in Boston, in which there
is about a column of arguments and figures on this “quail story 3²²
giving an estimato of the number of bushels of quails that were
piled up over the country, and showing that when they were
divided among the six million Israelites, each J ew would have
2, 888, 643 bushels of quails, which they were to eat during the
mouth, giving each poor Israelite 69,620 bushels of quail to eat
at each meal during the month3 and therefore the Bible was
not true! [Great laughter and applause.] That is the sort
of foed our skeptical friends love to eat. That is the meat
on which these Ooesars grow so wondrous great. ¹ 1 said to
this gentleman, “The Bible does not say any such thing1'‘ He
replied that it certainly did; but 1 answered that it did not say

any one could take as many of them as he chose. And this
skeptical friend had got the birds packed solid, three feet deep,
over a territory forty miles across. As if some one should say
that a flock of geese flew as high as Bunker Hill Monument,
and we should insist that they were packed solid from the ground
up, two hundred and twenty-one feet highl This⁴ is a sample
of the kind of arguments which infidels bring to prove that the
Bible is not truci

The Book, to my mind, bears the marks of inspiration in the
foresight which it exhibite. This Book foretells things. You

cannot do that. You cannot tell what will be next year, or
next week. “The spirits’' cannot tell who will be the next
