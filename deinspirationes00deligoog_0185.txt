things eternal and divine,——even the immediate vision of the
face of God was not only possible to man, but was the free
privilege of him who would seek it in the way appointed.
Divine visits and immediate revelatione were esteemed matters

the extent of the divine influence upon the sacred writers in
secular matters,1 ,

“Did the disciple in· the highest school of the spirit obtain
an insight into all those sciences which are learned in the school
of nature? I answer ‘ Yes’3 it was given them. to understand
all science, whether touching the courses of the heavenly bodies
