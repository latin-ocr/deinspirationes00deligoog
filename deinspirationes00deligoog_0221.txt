as secured the sacred writers against all error, but presupposed
that the general substance of⁴tl1e message was previously known
by natural means—reason or education, or antecedent revelation.

Whitby would nowhere admit slips of memory on the part of
the apostleS, 1101· would he concede that they determined practi-
cal questions on grounds of human expediency, apart from the
direction of the Holy Spirit.

He contended for such a kind and degree of inspiration as se-
cured perfect certainty as to the truth written, but not ξω· the
theory of verbal, mechanical dictatiou.

2. Samuel Clarke.

Dr. Olarke († 1729) insisted upon a careful observance of the
distinction between prophetie writings on the one hand, and his-
torical and moral compositions on the other. He says that ‘in
the prophetic books, where the subject-matter was entirely new

¹ to the prophet himself, and very often perhaps not understood

by him, it is very plain that inspiration means that the whole was
dictated to the inspired writerS, either in a vision, or by an angel,
or otherwise, according as it pleased God to reveal himself at
divers times and in diverse manners, But in the historical and
moral books of Scripture, wherein the writers had themselves
perfect knowledge of the facts recorded and of the doctrine
taught, it was abundantly sufficient that they had such assistance
of the Holy Spirit guiding them int'o all truth, as enabled them
to express their own thoughts in their own words, with an effec-
tual security that they should not err in the manner of delivering
the doctrine which they were commanded to teach.¹

3. Calamy.

Ed. Calamy († 17 32) held that the divine assistance given to the
sacred writers extended both to the formation of their conceptions
and the framing of their writings3 and that the assistance was of
such sort as to prevent the insertion of anything false, or the omis-
sion of any necessary truth. The Spirit immediately suggested
and dictated such things as were matters of 'pure revelation, and
illuminated their minds in the several doctrinal and practica]
truths they delivered jn writing.
