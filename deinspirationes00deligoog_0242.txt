5. Colerz'dqe.

It was Coleridge († 1834), perhaps, more than any one else, who
really domesticated in Eugland, and put in permanent circulation
there, views on the subject of inspiration hitherto current chiefly
in Germany, and based rather upon profound acquaintance with
German metaphysical philosophy, than with the genuine science of
Christian theology. The theory propounded in his ‘ Confessions
of an Inquiring Spirit'¹ is known sometimes as the ‘subjective,’
and again as one form of the ‘partial’ theory. Really it is both
subjective and partial.

a. He distinguishes carefully immediate divine revelation, con-
tained in the Law and the Prophets (and of course absolutely
infallible), from inffliration, or the actuation and assistance of the

Holy Spirit vouchsafed to the authors of other parts of Scriptura. ·

The latter is only the ‘highest degree of that grace and commun-
ion of the Spirit, which the church under all circumstanceS, and
every regenerate member of the church, is permitted to hope and
instructed to pray for.’ In other words, supernatural inspiration,
in the proper sense of the term, belongs only to the Law and the
ProphetS.

b. Consistently with his view, Coleridge admits errors and
discrepancies in those matters which ‘ stand in no necessary con-
nection with the known and especial ends and purposes of the
Scriptures.'

c. He bases his belief in the divinity of the ScriptureS, chiefly
upon the testimony of inward personal experience. ‘Whatever
finds me, bears witness for itself that it has proceeded from a
Holy spirit!

Some younger friends and followers of Ooleridge ,abandoned
his careful distinction between revelation and inspiration, wholly
displaced the supernatural element from the Bible, and ascribed
to it only such inspiration as is common to all believers.

6. Arnold.

One of the pupils of Thos. Amold († 1842) asserts that hc had
no accurate, precise, and sharply defined view of inspiration.'
