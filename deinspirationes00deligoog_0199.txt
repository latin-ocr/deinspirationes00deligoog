ondary author should be wholly overlooked, and attention exclu-
sively directed to the primary Author, the divine Originator.

b. Act of Inspiration.

According to the same theologians, the act of inspiration by the
Holy Ghost included three things: the impulse to write [i. e.,
the mere mechanica] operation of writing, for as Hollaz († 1713)
says: ‘⁶ The words were inspired within the prophete, not to be
understood, but to be written”], the suggestion of the matter, and
that of the words,

Thus Baier (†1695) defines inspiration as ‘⁶ an act of that kind
by which God supernaturally communicated to the intellect of
the writers, not only the ideas of all things which were to be re-
corded, but also of the words themselves, and of all things by
which they should be expressed3 and then roused the will to the
act of writing.’' ¹

Quenstedt says again ε’ “ All and everything which is contained
in the Holy ScriptureS, whether in the natural way wholly un-
known, or naturally, indeed, capable of being known, but actually
unknown3 or yet again, not only naturally apprehensible, but also
actually known, either from personal experience or from· some
other source—all this was not merely written by means of infal-
lible divine assistance and direction, but flowed from the special
suggestion, inspiration and dictation of the Spirit. For all which
was to be written, was suggested by ‚the Holy Ghost to the sacred
writers in the act of writing, and was dictated to their under-
standing as to a pe ι, so that it must be set down in writing with
these and no other conditions, in this and no other way.”

It is easily seen that this method of conceiving inspiration es-
tablished a real Docetism, through the sole activity of the divine
Spirit, and the annihilation of ‘all human spontaneity.'

c. Revelation and Inspiration.

A distinction was made between revelation and inspiration,
though it was not always kept clear and exact. It was taught
that the former relates properly to the communica-tion of truth
before unknown, and may be made in various ways and for vari-
ous purposeS. The latter relates by right only to the act of writing,
