talk about the Council. of Nico getting up the New Testament.
You might as well talk about s town-meeting getting up the
Revised Stetutes of the State of Massachusetts‚ because they hap-
pened to say they accepted or received them. The Council of
Nice did nothing of the kind. The books of the N ew Testament
were received from the opostles who wrote them, and were care-
fully preserved, and publicly read in the churches of Christ long

’ before the counen of Nice was hem.

Saye Tertullian, A. D. 200, “If you are willing to exerciso your
curiosity profitably in the business of your salvation, visit the
apostolic churches, in which the very chaire of the spostles still
preside in their placen in which their very mummio ὢτων, oero
recitod, sounding forth the voice and representing the counte-
mnce of every one oi them. Is Achaia near you! You have
Corinth. If you ere not far from Macedonia you have Philippi

These apostolic churches received the Gospels st the hands
of the men who wrote them, and the Epistles were written and
signed by men whom they well knew. Paul wrote, “The salu·

which they knew. 'rba apostle John does not say, “That which
we heve dreamed, magined, or guessed at, that thing do we

which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which
we heve looked upon, and our hands have handled‚ of the
Word of Life.” (1 John i. 1.) This was their testimony.
They testified thet they um Christ in his life and in his death;
that they saw him efter his resurrection, end felt his hands
and feet, end saw the nail-prints and the spem-wounds3
ond they knew these things and testified of them. They

’ preeched Christ, who had died and risen again. When a

certain skeptic said he proposed to start a new religion, and
ssked a friend for some suggestions es to his best course, the
friend replied, “1 would advise you to get yourself crucified,
