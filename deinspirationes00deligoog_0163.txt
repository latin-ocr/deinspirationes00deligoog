. Pharisees, ought to serve as a representative example of Pales-
tinian J ewish orthodoxy. Indeed, he iquuoted by most orthodox
writers as a valuable witness to the general acceptance of the
doctrine of plenary and verbal inspiration among his count-rymen.
He says: ‘⁶ Every one is not permitted, of his own accord, to
be a writer, nor is there any disagreement in what is written3
'they being only prophets that have written the originas and
earliest accounts of things, as they learned them of God

κ himself, by inspiration 3 and others have written what hath hap-

pened in their own time, and that in a very'distinct manner also.
For we have not· an innumerable multitude of books among
us, disagreeing from and contradicting one another, [as the
‘Greeks have], but only twenty-two bookS, which' contain the
records of all past timeS, which are justly believed to be divine.”¹
If this correctly represents the J ewish orthodoxy of the first cen-

tury A. D., it does not necessarily indicate the persona] opinions ’

of the author. It seems doubtful whether Josephus had any
Χ real belief in the inspiration of the Old Testament Scriptures.
If he had, how could he treat them as he does, while claiming
to make them the basis of his own history? How could he
jnmble together fact and fancy, divine wisdom and foolish phi-
losophy, veritable history and baseless tradition? Why should‘
he be so anxious to eliminate, by any and every possible method,
the miraculous and Messianic elements from the narrative with
which he has to deal 2 It will probably be hard to find such an
answer to these questions as will save the consistency and
character of the author. Still, the testimony of Josephns, such
as it is, is one which, in the meagreness of our information, we
could ill afford to lose.

3. Philo.

This learned Alexandrian is generally, and on the whole cor-
rectly, taken as the representative of the Hellenistic J ewish view
of inspiration. What has been said above of the general view
(ΙΙ.) will for the most part apply to him. When his opinions
are subjected to a close examination, they are found to be vagne,
especially on the psychological phenomena in question—how
much or how little activity he would assign to the personal
