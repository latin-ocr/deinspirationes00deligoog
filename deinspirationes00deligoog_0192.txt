40 THE DOCTRINE 01³· IN SPIRATION ἶ

Paul teach it. And again, what teaches Christ, that is apostolic,
even if J udas, Annas, Pilate and Herod teach it.” ¹

We sec from this that the critical spirit had been awakened in
Luther’s mind in reaction against the easy and unquestioning cred-
ulity of the church in which he had been trained. Although this
spirit proceeded from and was goverued by a living saith, rather
than by a merely intellectual interest and curiosity, yet it was not
sufficiently well instructed to restrain itself within due boundS.

4. To be at all consistent with himself, Luther should have res-
olutely rejected the striet theory of inspiration, which applied it

to the form as well as to the substance—the words as well as the ’

thoughts of the Scriptures. This he did in general. He would
acknowledge no mechanica] dictation of phraseology on the part
of the inspiring Spirit to the sacred writerS.

In his doctrine of the sacraments, however, he was compelled
to contradict himself, and make everything dependent on word
, and letter. Here he found the Bible ‘ a book in which more de-
pended on a single letter or a turn of the same, than on heaven
and earth.’ ⁴

mitted deqrees in inspiration, which he determined according to

the measure in which certain doctrines were more or less clearly, ,

intelligibly and convincingly set forth.

Heppe has said that no traces of a proper theory of inspiration
are to be found 1n Melancthon. No inference, however, is to be
drawn from this a's to the doctrina] unsounduess of the refol mer
on this subject. He clearly taught the infallibility of the apos-
tles in the statement, if not in the application of doctrinal
truth.

Zwingle does not, in his writingS, enter into detailed statements
concerning the theory of inspiration. His vieWS, however, while
preserving some features in common with those of Luther, appear
to have been much sounder, more churchly, and comparatively
free from the exaggerations of a critical spirit. They were de-
