16. Cowybeare.

W. D. Conybeare († 1857), held with reference to—

a. The nature of inspiration—-that the influence of the divin'e
Spirit so guided and guarded the sacred writers as to suggest all
essential and appropriate truth, and to preserve from, all error.
He rejected the notion of deqrees in inspiration‚ as unnecessary,
and unsupported by facte.

b. The artent of inspirationssthat the divine influence extended
not to verba] expression, but only to the securing of a certain and
, infallible standard of religious truth, from which there could be
no appeal. In points not concerning this, gnidanee was not needed
nor imparted. -Conybeare, for example, doubts if inspiration ex-
tended to all of Paul' s allusions to J ewlsh chronology. He
strenuously insists, however, that in matters bearing in any way
upon 7religion, no such allowances can be made.¹

mere channels for the transmission of infallible truth. The
working of the Holy spirit in them was analogous to his influenee

character, thought and feeling, and in the gradual development
of the ways and purposes of Grod in their mindS. As their
situation and office was peculiar and ’ unexampled, so for its fu]-
fillment peculiar and unexampled gifts were bestowed upon them.
One of these, in the case of the apostleS, was the recalling to
their minds by the Holy spirit of those things which our Lord
had said.n ,

Our author contends that divine· superintendence, as exercised
in the composition of the gospeIS, extended 110 farther than, that
general leading, which, in main and essential points, ensured har-
mony between the writers, He is strong in the conviction that
the phenomena of the gospels are inconsistent with the strict
