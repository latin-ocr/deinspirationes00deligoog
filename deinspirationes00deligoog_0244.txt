‘⁶ The prophetie power, in which, Ϊ suppose, is chiefly exhibited
that which we mean by inspiration, depends almost entirely on
moral gmatncss. The prophet discussed large principles, true for
'all time—principles social, political, ecclesiastical, and principles
of life, chiefly by largeness of heart, and sympathy 01 spirit with
Grod’s spirit. Τ leat ix my conceptimz, (gf φ’πκρίναίίωι.

“The inspiration 01 1110 Bible is a large subject. I hold it to
be inspired, not dictated. It is the word of God—the word of
man: as the former, perfect3 as the latter, imperfect. God the
Spirit, as the Sanctifier, does not produce absolute perfection of
human character3 God the Spirit, as an Inspirer, does not produce
absolute perfectiori of human knowledge3 and for the same reason
in both cases,—the human element which is mixed up—else there
could have been no progressive dispensations.

“ I hold it, therefore, as a proof of the inspiration of the Bible,
and divinely wise, to have given a spiritual revelation, i. e., a reve-
lation concerning the truths of the 80111 and its relation to God,
in popular and incorrect language. Do not mistake that word
incorrect,· incorrect is one thing, false another.”

Archdeacon J. O. Hare († 1855)‚·in common with other repre-
sentatives 01 1110 Broad-chureh school, attributes inspiration 10 1110
common grabe 01 God’s quickening and enlightening Spirit,
shared by the sacred writers in common with other Christians,
but possessed in greater measure. His general view is expressed
in a quotation which he makes approvingly from Ackermann, a
German theologian.

“ Theologians have 1101 infrequently been guilty 01 3 gross error
with regard to the biblioal idea of inspiration, from looking upon
it 38 11100113111031 instead of dogmatical. ’κ ³⁶ κ· Hence they
ought never to have adopted or encouraged the crude notion that
persons under inspiration were like so many drawers, wherein
the Holy Ghost put such and such things, which they then took
out as something ready-made, and laid before the world, 80 11131
