72 THE Doo'rnmn or msrma‘nout

either saith or practice, is infallibly true. ¹ It is no matter how
truth comes to us, if only we have ‚it fully 'and certainly.’'

He thinks the partia] theory important from an apologetic
'point of view, ⁶ to free the infallible word of Scripture from all
those embarassing circumstances which have been so artfully and
disingenuously thrown out to its discredit! ²

Dr. C. Middleton († 17 50), though a noted divine a1sd scholar
of the Ohurch of England‚ has often been regarded as a disbe-
liever in the fundamental truths of Christianity. Not only did

his views diverge from those even of the English latitudinaria-ns .

hitherto considered, but his whole spirit and character were so
different that, with his disciple Wakefield, he deserves a place by
himself at the end of the list. , .

His aim seems to have been to eradicate as far as possible the
supernatural clement from the ScriptureS, and to subvert by any
and every possible method the received view of their infallible
inspiration. Hesays bitterly that the orthodox doctrine on this
subject is ‘a clog and incumbrance to Christianity with all rational
and thinking men‚’ and ‘ has no other foundation but in the mis-
. taken sense of certain texts suggested by the prejudice of pious
men? ⁸ He grounds these statements partly on the so-called evi-
dence of fact, saying that ‘everyone may see apparent marks of
human frailty in the Scriptures‚ not only in style and langnage‚
but sometimes also in matter.'

The evangelists make not the least pretensions to infallibility,
and the apostles on some occasions distinctly disclaim it. Paul
was sometimes destitute of divine assistance in explaining partic-
ular doctrines3 and contradictions exist in the gospels which are
incapable of reconciliation.⁴ Two examples of his style of criti-
cism may illustrate his spirit and method:

‘⁶ Matthew either. wilfully suppressed or negligently omitted
three successive descents from father to son in the first chapter
of his gospel.⁵
