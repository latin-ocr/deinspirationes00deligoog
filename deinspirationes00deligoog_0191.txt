office with 'regard to the canon, we are not surprised at the way
in which he himself proceeded to the practica] execution of the
task. ’

He freely conceded the existence of imperfectione and errors in
the sacred recordS, arising either froin undue haste, or from for-
getfulness on the part of their authors : such, e. g'., as Paul's use of
the allegory of Hagar and Ishmael (Gal. 4 ε 22), and Peter's allu-
sion to Christ's preaching to the spirits in prison (1 Peter, 3:19).
‘All in the Bible is not pure silver, gold and precious stones;
one must look to find along with these hay, straw, stubble.’ Still
no harm is done, he thinks, provided only the foundation is well
laid. This is always the main thing to be regarded.¹

It may. be well to notice (though not quite germane to our im-
mediate subject), that Luther attributed very unequal value to
different books of the Old and New Testamenta Of the former,
he prized the Psalms most highly, while he reJ'ected Esther and
'Ecclesiastes as uncanonical, declared the history of J onah so mon-
strous as to be absolutely incredible, rated Chronicles as of inss

the RomanS, Galatians and Ephesiam), and the First of Peter.
The epistle of J ames, he designated as an ‘ epistle of straw,’ ‘ with
nothing evangelical about it,' because it exalts good works as re-
lated to faith. He felt the absence of the apostolic spirit in the
epistle to the HebreWS, (which he attributed to Apollos,) and
refused either an apostolic or prophetie character to the Apoca-
lypse. He says: ‘⁶' Ι certainly cannot detect any trace of its
having been inspired by the Hol y Ghost.’'

He specifies certain books which he regards as the kernel and
marrow of the sacred canon, because of their abundant testimony
to Christ.

Witness to Christ, and not apostolic authorship is in his
opinion the universal test of inspiration and canonicity. “ What
does not teach Christ, this is not apostolic even though Peter or
