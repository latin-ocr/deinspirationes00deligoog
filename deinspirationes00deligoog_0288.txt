these expressions must generally be understood as figurative,
and not as intended to be constructive of dogma; but in the
post-Reformation era these expressions are distinctly put forth
as having a dogmatic significance. The theory of this era, with
the remnants of it which survived in many quarters to the pres·
ent day, is, then, especially entitled to the title “ mechanical.”
But the mechanical theory makes at least two false and destruc-
tive assumptions. It assumes that inspiration consists wholly
in being acted upon, in being passive while an impression is
produced upon the mind as it were from without. It also as-
sumes that a ready-made product of truth, formally expressed
in language, is by divine miraculous action imported into the
mind. Nor is inspiration constructive; as it imparts no new
faculty, it causes no specifically different activity of any faculty.
Memory is still memory: intellect is still intellect. Th‘e rela-
tions of brain and mind in prophetie ecstasy are the same which
are partially familiar to all students of the frequent phenomena
of ecstasy in many places and times. But inspiration is dynam-
ical. It involves the illumining, purifying, and quickening of
all the mental powers which enter into the work of revelation;
because man, as a spiritual unity‚ is inspired in order that he
may receive the sels-communication of God.

4 Inspiration involveS, then, not only the recipiency of saith,
but also the activity of all man’s correlated powers, The recip-
iency of saith is not passivity; on the contrary, it involves the
highest kind of ethical activity. The imparting of truth re-
quires not only the activity of the spirit which impart5‚ but also
of the spirit to which the truth is imparted. The relation of
God to man in inspiration no more admits of pure passivity in
the latter than—to use a figure of speech which Mehring has
wrought out at some length—the relation of teacher to pupil.

5. Ecstasy is not the sole, nor even the typical form of bibli-
cal inspiration. The view maintained by Hengstenberg, and
even the modified view of E. Grai, which make ecstasy the only
condition of biblical revelation, quite breaks down. But the
⁴truth is rather as H. Schultz states it: “ As prose out of poetry‚
so certainly has the quiet utterance of truth come out of the
