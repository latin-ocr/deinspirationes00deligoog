problems presented by the Holy Scriptures, often J umped at con-
clusions from questionable premises, especially if thereby a blow
might be dealt at the hierarchy aud the traditional system it sup-
ported.

We do not forget that in Germany the new studies were pros-
cuted in a more religious spirit than elsewhere, aud that litera-
ture ultimately became the handmaid of religion; neither do wc
claim that the spirit above described was at all that in which the
reformers consciously approached the Scriptures3 but we do claim
that this was the 'atmosphere in which they grew up, and the

humanly speaking, that they should wholly escape its influence
in forming judgment of the Bible (then first- made accessible),
whether regard was had to its character and contente, or the influ-

None the less'was mysticism defective (as seen in its operations
during the Middle Ages) in overestimating the subjective, and
underrating the objective clement in religion. It regarded what
Christ does in us rather than for uS, and overlooked the necessity
and unique divinity of the written word, while it exalted the ⁶ in-
