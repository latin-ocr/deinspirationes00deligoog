soul. Even the personality of Christ remains fleshly and exter-
nal unless made known in and through a process of personal in-
spiration in the personality of the believer. This is the differ-
ence of which the Apostle speaks between knowing Christ after
the flesh and knowing him after the spirit.

’ This law extends to all the various faculties which are inspired
in the process of the divine self-revealing. Senses, intellect,
sensibilities, ethical and religious powers, can be operated upon
only in accordance with their fundamental laws. If they are in-
cited to activity at all, the nature of their activity must be con-
ditioned upon the constitution and place of each in the human
system of faculties. If the senses act in revelation and inspi-
ration, they will act as senses,· they will act, that is, as means
of becoming aware, primarily, only of certain changes in the so-
called forms of matter, and as conditioned upon the fundamental
fact that the organs of sense are themselves only a special kind

ο of matter, called nervous matter. To have a vision of God or

of angeIS, as an effect in the nervous system, would be to see
some form of so·called matter from which the divine or the an-
gelic presence might be inferred. To hear the divine voice, in a
literal sense, could never be anything more than to interpret a

certain affection of the nervous organism as originating in a .

divine act of causation. Memory of revelation, or inspired
memory, is always memory. An inspired argument, or infer-
ence, can never transcend the fundamental laws of the logical
faculty.

Especial emphasis must be laid upon the truth that the ethi-
cal nature of man furnishes certain necessary conditions of reve·
lation and inspiration, under the general law,—the contents of
revelation must become the contents of self-consciousness. The
contents of revelation are preeminently ethico-religious truths:
they are addressed and fitted to the nature of man as an ethical
and religious being. But with this truth goes another and kin-
dred truth: these contents are wrought out within the ethical
and religious self-consciousneSS. The truths of biblical revelation
are not, indeed, the merely natural product of these faculties;
otherwise, they would not be truths of revelation. But, on the
, other hand, they are truths divinely lodged in, or wrought out
within, the normal faculties of man's ethical and religious being.
